It gives me great pleasure to write a foreword to the Textbook of Preclinical Conservative
Dentistry. Preclinical Conservative Dentistry has assumed a lot of significance with relevance
to the rapid progress made in dental materials and instruments. Preclinical Conservative
Dentistry has been introduced as a separate examination subject bearing in mind the importance
it demands. This textbook forms the basis and backbone for a dental student for his future
clinical training. It assumes greater importance in view of the fact that these fundamentals
are to be properly imparted to the dental student.
    This book on Preclinical Conservative Dentistry explicitly deals with these fundamentals
in different Chapters dealing widely in introduction, description of teeth, instruments,
nomenclature, tooth preparation, filling materials including endodontics. The significance of
this book is that these fundamentals are explained in a simple understandable manner which will make the student grasp
the same without any strain or confusion. I am sure, this will also be useful as a handbook or reference book to all the
dentists as well.
    I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all dental students as well as dental surgeons and I heartily
congratulate Dr Nisha Garg on her excellent effort in bringing out this book in a presentable way.

Operative dentistry is one of the oldest branches of dental sciences forming the central part of dentistry as practiced in
primary care. It occupies the use of majority of dentist’s working life and is a key component of restorative dentistry. The
subject and clinical practice of conservative dentistry continues to evolve rapidly as a result of improved understanding of
etiology, prevention and management of common dental diseases. The advances and developments within the last two
decades have drastically changed the scope of this subject. But before taking professional training, gathering basic
knowledge along with operating skill is mandatory.
    The main objective of this book is to provide students with the knowledge required while they are developing necessary
clinical skills and attitude in their undergraduate training in conservative dentistry and endodontics. We have tried to cover
wide topics like morphology of teeth, cariology, different techniques, instruments and materials available for restorations
of teeth along with the basics of endodontics.
    So we can say that after going through this book, the student should be able to:
• Sit properly while operating and be able to organize their operating environment efficiently.
• Understand the morphology of teeth and differentiate one tooth from another.
• Chart teeth.
• Understand basics of cariology, its prevention and conservative management.
• Tell indications and contraindications of different dental materials.
• Apply modern pulp protective regimens.
• Select suitable restorative materials for restoration of teeth.
• Understand the basics of endodontic treatment like what are the indications of endodontic treatment, basic instruments,
    access preparation, biomechanical preparation and obturation of root canal system.

                                                                                                                 Amit Garg

                               groove. These groves end in shallow depressions in the
                               enamel of occlusal surface giving it a wrinkled
                               appearance.

         According to Sturdvent, “Operative dentistry is defined
     as science and art of dentistry which deals with diagnosis,
     treatment and prognosis of defects of the teeth which do
     not require full coverage restorations for correction.”
         Such corrections and restorations result in the restoration
     of proper tooth form, function and esthetics while
     maintaining the physiological integrity of the teeth in
     harmonious relationship with the adjacent hard and soft
     tissues. Such restorations enhance the dental and general
     health of the patient.
         According to Gilmore, “Operative dentistry is a subject                            Fig. 2.2: Maxillary central and lateral incisors

1st premolars, 5s are 2nd premolars, 6s are the 1st molar,
etc. up through 8s which are 3rd molars. The permanent
teeth quadrants are designated 1 to 4 such that 1 is upper
right, 2 is upper left, 3 is lower left and 4 is lower right,

Good knowledge of dental anatomy, histology, physiology
and occlusion is the foundation stone of operative dentistry.
In other words, thorough knowledge of morphology, dental
anatomy, histology, is essential to get optimal results of
operative dentistry. Though the dental tissues are passive,
the occurrence of caries can only be understood when the
structure of the teeth is understood.
    The teeth consist of enamel, dentin, pulp and cementum
(Fig. 3.1).

ENAMEL
Tooth enamel is the hardest and most highly mineralized
substance of the body which covers the crown of the tooth.
It is the normally visible dental tissue of a tooth which
is mainly responsible for color, esthetics, texture and

    Although enamel can serve lifelong, but it is more
susceptible to caries, attrition (physical forces) and fracture
due to its structural make up, i.e. mineralized crystalline
structure and rigidity. One of the interesting features of
enamel is that it cannot repair itself. So, loss in enamel surface
can be compensated only by restorative treatment.

Composition
It is highly mineralized structure which mainly contains
inorganic contents in the form of crystalline structure. Main
inorganic content in the enamel is hydroxyapatite. In addition                 Fig. 3.2: Diagram showing direction of enamel

Striae of Retzius
They appear as brownish bands in the ground sections and
illustrate the incremental pattern of enamel. These represent
the rest periods of ameloblast during enamel formation,
therefore also called as growth circles. When these circles
are incomplete at the enamel surface, it results in alternating
grooves called imbrications lines of pickerills, the elevations
in between called perikymata. Perikymata are shallow
furrows where the striae of Retzius end. These are conti-            Fig. 3.4: Showing pits and fissures of premolars and molars

    Striae of Retzius are stripes that appear on enamel when
viewed microscopically in cross-section. Formed from
changes in diameter of “Tomes” processes, these stripes
demonstrate the growth of enamel, similar to the annual
rings on a tree.

Prismless Layer
There is structureless layer of enamel near the cervical line
and to a lesser extent on the cusp tip which is more minera-
lized.

Dentin thickness is usually more on the cuspal heights and
incisal edges and less in the cervical areas of tooth. It is
around 3-3.5 mm on the coronal surface. With advancing
age and various irritants, the thickness of secondary and
tertiary dentin increases.

Hardness
The hardness of dentin is one-fifth that of enamel. Hardness
is not the same in all its thickness. Its hardness at the DEJ
is 3 times more than that near the pulp so it is important to
keep the depth of preparation near the DEJ. Hardness of
dentin also increases with advancing age due to minerali-
zation. Compressive hardness is about 266 MPa. The
modulus of elasticity is about 1.67 × 106 Psi. As the modulus
of elasticity of dentin is low, so it indicates dentin is flexible
in nature. The flexibility of dentin provides support or
cushion to the brittle enamel. The tensile strength of dentin              Fig. 3.8: Diagram showing course of dentinal tubules
is 40-60 MPa. It is approximately one-half of that of enamel.

                      Functions of dentin

Clinical Considerations of Dentin
1. As dentin is known to provide strength and rigidity to
   the tooth, care should be taken during tooth preparation.
2. Tooth preparations should be done under constant air
   water spray to avoid build up of heat formation which,
   in further, damages dental pulp.
3. Dentinal tubules are composed of odontoblastic

Through the nervous system, pulp transmits sensations
mediated through enamel or dentin to the higher nerve
centers. Pulp transmits pain, also senses temperature and
touch.

Defense of Tooth
Odontoblasts form dentin in response to injury particularly
when original dentin thickness has been compromised as in
caries, attrition, trauma or restorative procedure.

Age Changes in Pulp
Pulp like other connective tissues, undergoes changes with
time. Pulp can show changes in appearance (morphogenic)
                                                                         Fig. 3.16: Diagrammatic representation of pulp stones

    factors for caries because of their ability to adhere to
    tooth surfaces, produce abundant amounts of acid, and
    survive and continue metabolism at low pH conditions.
    Colonization with Streptococcus mutans at an early age
    is an important factor for early caries initiation.

Time Period
The time period during which all above three direct factors,
i.e. tooth, microorganisms and substrate are acting jointly
should be adequate to produce acidic pH which is critical
for dissolution of enamel to produce a carious lesion. Time
required for acid production from the fermentation of the
carbohydrates by bacteria and for demineralization of tooth,                    Fig. 4.8: Smooth surface caries

CLASSIFICATION OF DENTAL CARIES
Carious lesions can be classified in different ways.

According to their Anatomical Site
•   Pit and fissure caries (Fig. 4.7): Pit and fissure caries
    occur on occlusal surface of posterior teeth and buccal
    and lingual surfaces of molars and on lingual surface of
    maxillary incisors.
•   Smooth surface caries (Fig. 4.8): Smooth surface caries
    occurs on gingival third of buccal and lingual surfaces
    and on proximal surfaces.                                                         Fig. 4.9: Root caries

Backward Caries
When spread of caries along dentinoenamel junction exceeds
the adjacent caries in enamel, it is called backward caries
(here caries extend from DEJ to enamel).

Based on Number of Tooth Surfaces Involved
Simple caries: Caries involving only one tooth surface is
termed as simple caries (Fig. 4.14).

systematic manner. The clinician should be familiar with
normal radiographic landmarks.

 •   Enamel: It is the most radiopaque structure.
 •   Dentin: Slightly darker than enamel.
 •   Cementum: Similar to dentin in appearance.
 •   Periodontal ligament: Appears as a narrow radiolucent
     line around the root surface.
 •   Lamina dura: It is a radiopaque line representing the
     tooth socket.
 •   Pulp cavity: Pulp chamber and canals are seen as
     radiolucent lines within the tooth.

                                                 Instrument Formula

                                                 GV Black established an instrument formula for describing
                                                 dimensions of blade, nib or head of instrument and angles
                                                 present in shank of the instrument (Fig. 5.5). The formula
                                                 is usually printed on the handle consisting of a code of
                                                 three or four numbers separated by spaces.
                                                     The first number of the formula indicates width of the
                                                 blade or primary cutting edge in tenths of a millimeter
                                                 (Fig. 5.6).
                                                     The second number represents the angle formed by the
                                                 primary cutting edge and long axis of the instrument handle
                                                 in clockwise centigrade. The instrument is positioned in

                                                 measured in clockwise centigrades. If the cutting edge is at
                                                 right angle to the length of the blade, then this number is

                                                 represents the length of the blade in millimeters, that is,
                                                 from the shank to the cutting edge (Fig. 5.7).
                                                     The fourth number (third number in three number code)
                                                 represents the angle which the blade forms with the long
                                                 axis of the handle or the plane of the instrument in clockwise
                                                 centigrade. To calculate the measurement of the angle, place
                                                 the instrument on the center of the circle and move it until
                                                 the blade lines up with one line on the ruler. This measure-
                                                 ment represents the angulation of the blade from the long
                                                 axis of the handle. To keep balance during working, tip of
                                                 blade is brought in the line of the long axis of the handle.

are named as right and left bevel instruments. During use,
move the instrument from right to left in right beveled
instrument and from left to right in left bevel instrument.
Identification of bevel: Hold the instrument in such a way
that the primary cutting edge faces downwards and pointing
away from operator. If bevel is on the right side of the
blade, the instrument is right sided and if bevel is on the left
side of the blade the instrument is left sided.
Mesial and distal bevel instrument: If we observe the inside
of the blade curvature and the primary bevel is not visible
then the instrument has a distal bevel and if the primary
bevel can be seen from the similar viewpoint the instrument
has a mesial or reverse bevel.

Bibeveled Instrument
If two additional cutting edges extend from the primary
cutting edges, then the instrument with secondary cutting
edges is called bibeveled instrument.

Triple-beveled Instrument
If three additional cutting edges extend from the primary
cutting edge, then the instrument is called triple-beveled             Figs 5.9A to D: (A) Photograph showing mouth mirror (B to D)

Burnisher
Burnishers are the kind of instruments which make the
surface shiny by rubbing. They are used to smoothen and
polish the restoration and to remove scratches present on
the amalgam surface after its carving. Burnishers have
smooth rounded working ends and come in single and
double-ended types (Figs 5.33A and B).                                         Fig. 5.34: Composite resin instruments

    Different types of burnishers are available but most
commonly used are:                                           •        Shaping of metal matrix bands.

2. Beavetail condenser—narrow type of burnisher.             •        Burnishing margins of cast gold restoration.
3. Ovoid burnisher—comes in various sizes such as 28,

Burnishers are used for:                                     The working ends on these instruments range from varying
• Final condensation of amalgam.                             small cylinders to angled, paddle like shapes (Fig. 5.34).
• Initial shaping of occlusal anatomy of amalgam.            Composite resin instruments are made of plastic or titanium
                                                             coating. Advantages of using plastic instruments are that

Teeth and periodontium are designed in such a manner that
mutually they significantly contribute to their own health
and support. They are complimentary to each other. Proper
form and alignment of teeth protect periodontium. During
mastication, the contours of teeth as a unit protect the                  Fig. 6.1: Interproximal spaces of anterior teeth

                                                    providing accessibility to the proximal area of class II

                                                    in repositioning of shifted teeth.

                                                 Methods of Tooth Separation
                                                 There are two methods which are usually used for tooth
                                                 separation. These are:
                                                 1. Slow or delayed separation                                                    Fig. 6.22: Separating rings

                                                 Advantages: One of the main advantages of slow tooth
                                                 separation is that tooth repositioning occurs without damage

TERMINOLOGY OF TOOTH PREPARATION

Tooth Preparation
It is a mechanical alteration of a defective, injured or diseased
tooth in order to best receive a restorative material which
will re-establish the healthy state of the tooth including
esthetics correction when indicated along with normal form
and function (Fig. 7.4).                                                      Fig. 7.5: Simple tooth preparation involving
                                                                                        one tooth surface only
Simple, Compound and
Complex Tooth Preparation
Simple Tooth Preparation
A tooth preparation involving only one tooth surface is
termed simple preparation (Fig. 7.5). For example, mesial,
distal, occlusal, buccal, lingual tooth preparation.

Compound Tooth Preparation
A tooth preparation involving two surfaces is termed
compound tooth preparation (Fig. 7.6). For example,
mesio-occlusal (MO), disto-occlusal (DO), mesiolingual
(ML), or distobuccal (DB) tooth preparation.

Complex Tooth Preparation                                                       Fig. 7.6: Compound tooth preparation

A tooth preparation involving more than two surfaces is
called as complex tooth preparation (Fig. 7.7). For example,

Enameloplasty
Enameloplasty is the careful removal of sharp and irregular
enamel margins of the enamel surface by “rounding” or
“saucering” it and converting it into a smooth groove making
it self-cleansable, finishable and allowing conservative
placement of margins (Figs 7.40A and B). Enameloplasty

Pulp Protection

Pulp protection is a very important step in adapting the
preparation for final restoration although actually it is not a
step of tooth preparation. When remaining dentin thickness
is less, pulpal injury can occur because of heat production,
high speed burs with less effective coolants, irritating
restorative materials, galvanic currents due to fillings of
dissimilar metals, excessive masticatory forces transmitted
through restorative materials to the dentin and ingress of
microorganisms and their noxious products through
microleakage.
    Pulp protection is achieved using liners, varnishes and
bases depending upon:
• The amount of remaining dentin thickness
• Type of the restorative material used.                              Fig. 7.48: Grooves are placed in axiofacial and axiolingual

These are normally prepared in the proximal walls of class

• Powder is dispensed at one end of glass slab, using
    cement spatula. The powder is divided in main bulk
    increment, followed by smaller increments (Figs 8.3
    and 8.4). While dispensing liquid, bottle should be held
    90° to the mixing pad. It lets the fluid fall under its own
    weight.
• Start the mixing by incorporating half of the powder
    into the liquid with a heavy folding motion and pressure.
• When powder particles are wet with the liquid, add the                      Fig. 8.4: Diagrammatic representation of

    folding motion to attain a putty consistency.
• For base, when mixing is done, bring the mix together
    and role it. One should be able to pick up the mix without
    deformation (Fig. 8.5).
• Pick-up a piece of mixed cement and place it into the
    preparation using a condenser.
• If the mix sticks to the condenser, powder the condenser
    head with cement powder to prevent the instrument from
    sticking during condensation.
• Use the condenser head and merge the restoration to
    the margin of the preparation.
• For smoothening, clean up and hardening of the
    restoration, use a wet cotton pellet.
• For luting consistency, “1 inch” string should be formed                     Fig. 8.5: Right consistency of ZOE mix

                     Test for trituration
 1. Normal trituration
    • Good shiny mix
    • Homogeneous mass, adheres together
 2. Overtrituration
    • Mix is ‘warm’
    • Difficult to remove from capsule
    • Shiny wet and soft
 3. Undertrituration
    • Dry mix
    • Crumbled mix that is very weak

Mulling
Mulling is done so that all alloy particles are properly coated
with mercury, in other words it is continuation of the
trituration. Mulling of the amalgam can be done manually
or mechanically. By hand, it can be done by squeezing the
freshly mixed amalgam collected in the chamois skin. Mulling
should not be done by bare hands as it can be contaminated
by moisture. Mechanical mulling is done in the amalgamator
by triturating it for one to two seconds.

    The strength of the bases depends upon the size,
thickness and mechanical properties of base along with
preparation design, position and amount of occlusal load.

Finishing of the Enamel Walls and Margins
Finishing of walls and margins is guided by the knowledge
of dental histology. At this stage all unsupported enamel is
removed. Cavosurface angle, i.e. angle between enamel wall
and amalgam interface should be made 90° butt joint type.
This provides bulk to restoration, which in turn provides
maximum strength.

Final Cleaning and Inspection of the Preparation
The final stage of tooth preparation is to clean the pre-                           Fig. 10.15: Conventional tooth preparation of
paration thoroughly with water and air spray. Then dry it                            maxillary first molar involving oblique ridge

•   Consider enameloplasty wherever required to conserve
    tooth structure.
•   Visualize the proximal box relative to contact area before
    extending into proximal marginal ridge, this will prevent
    the over extension of the occlusal outline form.
•   Outline form in the proximal area is primarily determined
    by the faciolingual position of the contact area and the
    extent of carious lesion. External outline form on the
    occlusal portion is extended to just break contact with
    the adjacent tooth.
•   While maintaining the established pulpal depth and with            Fig. 10.22: Faciolingual dimension of proximal box are

    the preparation towards the contact area of the tooth,
    ending short by 0.8 mm of cutting through the marginal
    ridge (Fig. 10.20). The proximal cutting is sufficiently
    deep into the dentin (0.5-0.6 mm) so that retentive locks
    are prepared into axiolingual and axiofacial line angles
    (Fig. 10.21).
•   Widen the preparation faciolingually to just clear the
    contact areas. The proximal cut is diverged gingivally.
    In other words, faciolingual dimension at the gingival
    surface is greater than the occlusal surface, this provides
    good retention and conservation of marginal ridge
    (Fig.10.22).
•   Keep a small slice of enamel at the contact area to prevent

    the conventional preparation is made only on the root
    with 90° cavosurface margins. In the crown portion of
    the preparation, the retention is mostly achieved by
    adhesive bonding to enamel and dentin.
•   The external walls are made perpendicular to the root
    surface.
•   While preparing, there should be adequate removal of
    caries, old restoration or defective tooth structure. The
    external walls of the preparation should be located on
    sound tooth structure with a cavosurface angle of
    90° for butt joint relation.

    paration is kept 0.75 mm. After this, it is deepened
    wherever caries is present.
•   Retention in conventional tooth preparation is attained
    by:
    – Roughening of the preparation surface
    – Parallelism or convergence of opposing external walls
    – Giving retention grooves and coves (Fig. 11.17).
•   Grooves can be placed continuous or isolated. Conti-
    nuous groove is placed in external walls, parallel to tooth
    surface. It should be located at least 1 mm from the
    tooth surface and at least 0.5 mm deep into dentin.

1. For composite restorations, the amount of contouring
   required after final polymerization of the composite can
   be reduced by careful placement technique. Minimizing
   contouring retains the sealed margins of the restoration.
   It also helps minimizing microcracks which can be
   formed by using abrasives on the surface of restoration.
2. Remove flash with a sharp hand instrument. Any excess
   material can be trimmed with sharp scalpel blade
   no. 11, composite finishing diamond bur and/or
   multibladed tungsten carbide finishing bur. Use a coolant/
   lubricant in gross reduction to reduce production of heat
   and friction.
3. Gross contouring of proximal restoration can be done
   using a small and thin disc rotating from 90° towards
   the facial surface (Fig. 11.33).
4. Contact areas may be finished by using a series of
   abrasive finishing strips threaded below the contact point
   so as not to destroy the contact point (Fig. 11.34). In
   class III restoration, to avoid any damage to contact
   point, the finishing strip should be used in S-shaped
   pattern. If strip is pulled on same side it can lead to open

became most popular from the 1930s to the 1970s because
of their acceptable functions and restorative longevity. Most
of the cast metal restorations are made from alloys formed
by combination of gold with other metals such as silver,
copper, zinc, platinum and palladium. Casting procedures
have been used for replacement of teeth by means of fixed
and removable partial denture prosthesis, and full mouth
restorations.
    In operative dentistry, cast metal restorations are mainly
used in three forms:
1. Inlay                                                                             Fig. 12.1: Class II inlay

the use of this technique to make statues and artistic pieces.
Dr Taggart developed a technique of casting gold inlays by
the invested wax pattern method, introduced this to the
profession in 1907.
    In 1897, Dr Philbrook read a paper “Cast Fillings”.
    In 1908, Dr JG Lane developed casting into a hot mold
using an investment with a high silica content.
    In 1909, Dr CS Van Horn evaluated wax expansion, this
was an attempt to overcome the effects of shrinkage of the
gold alloy.
    In 1930, Dr Carl Scheu discovered the phenomenon of
hygroscopic setting expansion.

vital to success of cast metal restorations then as they are
today.
Inlay: An inlay is an indirect intracoronal restoration which
is fabricated extraorally and cemented in the prepared tooth.
Inlay may cover none, or all but one cusp of a tooth.
Onlay: An onlay is a combination of intracoronal and
extracoronal cast restoration which covers one or more
cusps.
Class II inlay: Class II inlay essentially involves proximal
surface or surfaces of a posterior tooth, usually may involve
occlusal surface and also may involve facial and/or lingual
surface(s) and covers none or may cover all but one cusp
of a tooth (Fig. 12.1).
Class II onlay: Class II onlay is a modification of the inlay
and involves the proximal surface or surfaces, and may                  Fig. 12.3: Crown given on root canal treated tooth

Steps
•   Cusp reduction should be started after making a groove
    (Fig. 12.32). Groove helps in accurate and uniform
    cutting. Different cusps require reduction according to
    the situation of a particular cusp, in other words all cusps
    do not require equal reduction.
•   While reducing the adjacent cusp, lingual or buccal
    developmental groove should be involved in cutting.

INTRODUCTION
By definition, pulp is a soft tissue of mesenchymal origin
residing within the pulp chamber and root canals of teeth.
    Some important features of pulp are as follows
(Fig. 13.1):
• Pulp is located deep within the tooth, so defies
    visualization.
• It gives radiographic appearance as radiolucent line.
• Pulp is a connective tissue with several factors making
    it unique and altering its ability to respond to irritation.
• Normal pulp is a coherent soft tissue, dependent on its
    normal hard dentin shell for protection and hence, once
    exposed, extremely sensitive to contact and temperature
    but this pain does not last for more than 1-2 seconds
    after the stimulus removed.                                         Fig. 13.1: Diagrammatic representation of dental pulp

   McCoy (1995) gave following definitions for these
terms:
1. Sealer: These materials provide a protecting covering
   the walls of tooth preparation and act as barrier to leakage
   occurring at restoration tooth interface.
   These can be :
   • Varnish: A varnish is an organic gum or rosin sus-
       pended in organic solutions like ether or chloroform.
   • Adhesive sealer: These help in sealing and adhesion
       at the tooth restoration interface. For example, dentin                      Fig. 13.14: Varnish
       bonding agent and resin luting cements (Fig. 13.13).
2. Liners: They are applied in thin layer of less than
   0.5 mm so as to attain a physical barrier to pulp and to
   provide therapeutic effect.
3. Bases: They are applied in an attempt to replace the lost
   dentin and to provide thermal, physical and therapeutic
   advantages to the pulp.

Varnish
A varnish is an organic copal or resin gum suspended in
solutions of ether or chloroform (Fig. 13.14). When applied
on the tooth surface the organic solvent evaporates leaving
behind a protective film (Fig. 13.15).                            Fig. 13.15: Varnish is applied on prepared tooth surface

Endo is a Greek word for “Inside” and Odont is Greek
word for “Tooth”. Endodontic treatment treats inside of
the tooth.
    Endodontics is the branch of clinical dentistry associated
with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the pathosis
of the dental pulp and their sequelae.

  Main aim of the endodontic therapy involves to:
   i. Maintain vitality of the pulp.
  ii. Preserve and store the tooth with damaged and necrotic
      pulp.
 iii. Preserve and restore the teeth which have failed to the
      previous endodontic therapy, to allow the tooth to remain
      functional in the dental arch.
                                                                        Fig. 14.1: Normal anatomy of a tooth showing enamel,

Canal orifices are openings in the floor of pulp chamber
leading into root canals.

Root Canal
The root canal extends from canal orifice to the apical
foramen. In anterior teeth, the pulp chamber merges into
the root canal (Fig. 14.37) but in multirooted posterior teeth
this division becomes quite obvious (Fig. 14.38).
Apical root anatomy: It is based on following anatomic
and histological landnarts in the apical part of the root canal:
    i. Apical constriction (Minor diameter): It is apical
       part of root canal having the narrowest diameter short
       of the apical foramina or radiographic apex. It may or      Fig. 14.37: Root canal anatomy of anterior tooth
       may not coincide with CDJ.
   ii. Apical formen (Major diameter): It is main apical
       opening on the surface of root canal through which
       blood vessels enter the canal. Its diameter is almost
       double the apical constriction giving it a funnel shape
       appearance, witch has been described as morning
       glory or hyperbolic. Average distance between minor
       and major diameter in young person is 0.5 mm and in
       older person, it is 0.7 mm.
  iii. Cementodentinal junction: Cementodentinal
       junction is the point in the canal, where cementum
       meets dentin. The position of CDJ varies but usually
       it lies 0.1 mm from the apical foramen (Fig. 14.39).

Definition of Access Cavity Preparation
Access cavity preparation is defined as endodontic coronal
preparation which enables unobstructed access to the canal
orifices, a straight line access to apical foramen, complete
control over instrumentation and to accommodate obturation         Fig. 14.38: Root canal anatomy of posterior tooth

technique.
    The main objective of the access cavity preparation is
to create a smooth, straight line access to the canal system
and the apex. The optimal access cavity results in the straight
entry into the canal orifices with line angles forming a funnel
which drops smoothly into the canals (Fig. 14.40).

 An ideal access preparation should have following
    qualities:
 1. An unobstructed view into the canal.
 2. A file should pass into the canal without touching any
    part of the access cavity.
 3. No remaining caries should be present in access cavity.
 4. Obturating instruments should pass into the canal
    without touching any portion of the access cavity.

5. Remove the chamber roof completely as this will allow
   the removal of all the pulp tissue, calcifications, caries
   or any residuals of previous fillings (Fig. 14.45). If pulp
   chamber is not completely deroofed, it can result in:
   a. Contamination of the pulp space.
   b. Discoloration of endodontically treated tooth.
6. The walls of pulp chamber are flared and tapered to
   form a gentle funnel shape with larger diameter towards
   occlusal surface (Fig. 14.46).
7. Endodontic access cavity is prepared through the
   occlusal or lingual surface never through proximal or
   gingival surface. If access cavity as made through
   wrong entry, it will cause inadequate canal instru-
   mentation resulting iatrogenic errors (Figs 14.47 and

•   After the straight line access of the canal is confirmed
    by passing a file passively into the canal, one should
    evaluate the access cavity using magnification and
    illumination.
•   Finally smoothening of the cavosurface margins of
    access cavity is done because rough or irregular cavity
    margins can cause coronal leakage through restorations.
    Also smooth cavity margins allow better and précised
    placement of final composite restoration with minimal
    coronal leakage.                                                          Fig. 14.53: Outline of access cavity of maxillary incisor

ACCESS CAVITY PREPARATION FOR
MAXILLARY MOLARS
Though the technique of access cavity preparation of molar
is similar to that of anterior teeth and premolar but because
of anatomic differences, they are discussed separately.

                                                     Basically this technique involves the canal preparation
                                                 into two phases; phase I involves the preparation of apical
                                                 constriction and phase II involves the preparation of the
                                                 remaining canal.

                                                 Phase I

                                                 1. Evaluate the carious tooth before initiating endodontic
                                                    treatment (Fig. 14.79).
                                                 2. Initially prepare the access cavity, and locate the canal
                                                    orifices (Fig. 14.80).
                                                 3. Establish the working length of the tooth using pathfinder.

                                                 5. Remove the instrument and irrigate the canal.
                                                 6. Don’t forget to lubricate the instrument for use in apical
                                                    area because it is shown that lubricant emulsifies the
                                                    fibrous pulp tissue allowing the instrument to remove it
                                                    whereas irrigants may not reach the apical area to
                                                    dissolve the tissues.
                                                 7. Place the next larger size files to the working length in
                                                    similar manner and again irrigate the canal (Fig. 14.82).
                                                 8. Don’t forget to recapitulate the canal with previous
                                                    smaller number instrument. This breaks up apical debris
                                                    which are washed away with the irrigant.
                                                 9. Repeat the process until a size 25 K-file reaches the
                                                    working length (Fig. 14.83). Recapitulate between the
                                                    files by placing a small file to the working length (Fig.        Fig. 14.81: Watch winding motion with gentle clockwise and
                                                    14.84).                                                                        anticlockwise motion of the file

                                                Phase II




                                                                                                                  Basics of Endodontics
                                                1. Place next file in the series to a length 1 mm short of
                                                   working length. Insert the instrument into the canal with
                                                   watch winding motion, remove it after circumferential
                                                   filing, irrigate and recapitulate (Fig. 14.85).
                                                2. Repeat the same procedure with successively larger files
                                                   at 1 mm increments from the previously used file (Fig.
                                                   14.86).
                                                3. Similarly mid canal area and coronal part of the canal is
                                                   prepared and shaped with larger number files (Figs 14.87
                                                   and 14.88).
