            It has been a labour of love, inspiration, hard work and perseverance in publishing this
            Preclinical Manual of Conservative Dentistry.
               Conservative Dentistry forms the backbone and foundation of clinical dentistry. This
            subject is introduced to the students of dentistry in the ﬁrst year of the curriculum. In the
            second year of the course, the students are required to identify instruments and equipment,
            understand and manipulate the various dental materials, and perform certain preclinical
            plaster and typhodont teeth exercises. They appear for a preclinical examination at the end
            of the second year before entering into the clinical work on patients in the third year.
               In my own experience as an undergraduate student, I found it very difﬁcult to comprehend
            this subject for two speciﬁc reasons: primarily, the student is expected to learn this from
            textbooks which are meant for the ﬁnal year BDS student and secondly, all the available
            textbooks are theoretically oriented without any practical guidance. The inspiration to create
            this manual came from my admiration for the textbook Fundamentals of Fixed Prosthodontics
            (2nd edn) by Herbert T Shillingburg. As a postgraduate student, I was amazed at the clarity of
            images and illustrations which made learning complex clinical exercises simpler and learner
            friendly. I have employed a similar template for creating a step wise chairside manual from
            which a student can learn and refer to while performing the preclinical exercises.
               This book consists of altogether 9 chapters.
               Chapter 1: Synopsis of Conservative Dentistry discusses structure of teeth and supporting
            tissues, nomenclature and tooth numbering systems, dental caries, noncarious loss of tooth
            structure, types of restorations and introduction to endodontics.
               Chapter 2: Instruments and Equipment includes clear description with illustration of every
            instrument and equipment a student is expected to know, identify and use before entering
            the clinical section.
               Chapter 3: Materials and Their Manipulation provides details regarding the composition,
            properties, uses and manipulation of the various dental materials employed in the ﬁeld of
            conservative dentistry.
               Chapter 4: Know Your Operating Field includes clear description with images of the
            phantom head and typhodont teeth used in the preclinical laboratory along with a beginner’s
            pictorial guide in using the airotor and micromotor rotary instruments.

                           “I keep six honest servingmen (they taught me all I knew);
                   their names are What and Why and When and How and Where and Who...”
                                                                                   — Rudyard Kipling
           Operative dentistry is the art and science of the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of
           defects of teeth that do not require full coverage restorations for correction. It involves the
           restoration of proper tooth form, function, and aesthetics while maintaining the physiologic
           integrity of the teeth in harmonious relationship with the adjacent hard and soft tissues. It
           is also referred as Restorative Dentistry or Conservative Dentistry.
              Patients seek dental treatment for symptoms such as pain, sensitivity, trauma, decay,
           bleeding gums, discolouration of teeth and for aesthetic corrections. The management of
           most of these problems are under the purview of this branch of dentistry. Hence, restorative/
           conservative dentistry forms the core of any dental practice.
           Restorative dentistry/conservative dentistry deals with:
            Prevention of dental diseases
            Interception of degenerative processes
            Preservation of the oral tissues
            Restoration of lost tooth structure
            Aesthetic correction of discoloured or malaligned teeth




           INDICATIONS FOR CONSERVATIVE DENTISTRY

           STRUCTURE OF TEETH AND SUPPORTING TISSUES
           A tooth has a crown portion seen clinically in the oral cavity and a root portion embedded in
           a bony socket surrounded by the periodontium (Fig 1.1).

            Also called as angular or grid system.
            Deciduous teeth are denoted by upper case English alphabets A to E with A representing
             central incisor and E representing second molar.
            Simple to use but not universal in application.
            Each tooth is not denoted by a speciﬁc number.
            No differentiation between the same tooth present in the right and left side of the same
             arch. For example the nomenclature is the same for both left and right maxillary teeth
             and so is the case for left and right mandibular teeth.

           The shaping, removal and restoration of tooth structure are the three essential aspects of
           restorative dentistry. Instruments are small hand held devices which are used for various
           procedures while treating a patient, e.g. mouth mirrors, probes, tweezers, condensers.
           Equipment are larger devices which aid the clinician while treating a patient, e.g. dental
           chair, operating stool, x-ray unit, amalgamator.


           MATERIALS USED FOR MANUFACTURING INSTRUMENTS
              1. Carbon steel: They contain 0.5−1.5 % carbon in iron. They are harder and sharper than
                 stainless steel but tend to corrode and are prone for fracture.
              2. Stainless Steel
                   a. Pure stainless steel: It is an alloy comprising of 70−85% Iron, 15−25 % of chromium
                      and 1−2 % of carbon. They are the most commonly used material for the manufacture
                      of dental instruments. Their main disadvantage is their tendency to lose their
                      sharpness due to repeated usage.
                   b. Stainless steel with teﬂon/titanium nitride coating: These are instruments which
                      are speciﬁcally used for the placement and handling of dental composites. The
                      advantage is that the composite does not stick to this coating and make the
                      placement of composites simpliﬁed.
              3. Carbide inserts: Some instruments are made with carbide inserts to provide more
                 durable cutting edges.
              4. Others: Other alloys of nickel, cobalt or chromium are used in the manufacture of hand
                 instruments.

            Clinical Note:
             1. Of the cutting edge tips, if the tip that is closer to the shaft forms an acute angle, it is
                 the mesial GMT and if it forms an obtuse angle, it is identiﬁed as a distal GMT.
             2. If the second number of the instrument formula is 75−85 then, it is a mesial GMT.
             3. If the second number of the instrument formula is 90−100 then, it is a distal GMT.
             4. The mesial 75−distal 100 pair of GMTs are used for inlay−onlay cavity preparations.
             5. The mesial 85−distal 90 pair of GMTs are used for amalgam cavity preparations.

            The pad of the middle ﬁnger is near the top side of the instrument for good control and
             cutting pressure.
            A balanced instrument design allows the application of suitable force without the instru-
             ment tending to rotate in the ﬁngers.

           involves the wrist the modified pen grasp involves the forearm

           2. Inverted pen grasp
              This is similar to the modiﬁed pen grasp except that the hand is rotated so that the palm
               faces more towards the operator (Fig 2.53).

           Bur blade design (Fig 2.70)
            The actual cutting action of a bur (or a diamond) takes place in a very small region at the
             edge of the blade.
            Each blade has two sides
             a. Rake face (towards the direction of cutting)
             b. Clearance face (away from the direction of cutting)
            Each blade has three important angles (Fig 2.71):
             a. Rake angle: The rake angle is the angle between the rake face and the radial line.

           PROPERTIES OF AN IDEAL DENTAL RESTORATIVE MATERIAL
           According to Anusavice, an ideal dental restorative material should have the following
           properties:
              i. Biocompatible
             ii. Bond permanently to tooth structure
            iii. Match the natural appearance of tooth structure
             iv. Exhibit properties similar to those of the enamel and dentin
              v. Capable to initiating tissue repair or regeneration of missing or damaged tissues
             However, there is not a single restorative material which would fulﬁl all of the above
           requirements. Hence, a student/clinician should be able to assess the given clinical condition
           and choose the right restorative material for the given clinical situation.
             Technological advancements and improvements in the ﬁeld of research in basic sciences
           have lead to the development of several new materials. Knowledge and understanding of
           composition, properties, behaviour, limitations of these materials are necessary for the
           proper selection of an appropriate material.


           RATIONALE FOR STUDYING DENTAL MATERIALS
              1. To understand the properties and behaviour of materials.
              2. To be able to handle and manipulate the materials properly.
              3. To be able to assess and use the appropriate material for the given clinical condition.
              4. To be able to educate patients.

           Properties of Materials
              1. Physical properties: These involve reversible interactions of a material with the
                 environment. This includes:

           Acid Etching of Enamel/Dentin
           It was conceived by Michael Buonocore in the 1950’s.
              This is one of the most effective ways of improving the bond and marginal seal between
           resins and the enamel/dentin.
              It involves the application of 37% phosphoric acid (preferably in gel form) for 15 seconds over
           the tooth structure to be restored followed by rinsing with water for 10−15 seconds (Figs 3.54
           and 3.55). It is supplied in a coloured gel form preloaded in a syringe (Fig 3.56).
              It results in a frosty white appearance due to the removal of enamel prism cores and
           peripheries creating microporosity (Figs 3.57 to 3.59).

           Mechanism
              (i) They are adhesion promoting agents and contain hydrophilic monomers dissolved in
                  solvents such as acetone, ethanol and/or water.


             (ii) The solvents displace water from the moist dentin surface thereby promoting the
                  inﬁltration of the resin monomers into the etched and demineralised substrate.


            (iii) This zone of resin inﬁltrated demineralised dentin is commonly referred to as hybrid
                  layer.


             (iv) Primers also contain hydrophobic monomers that would copolymerize with the
                  adhesive resin.
           B. Adhesive resin
           The adhesive resin, also called as the bonding agent, is similar to the enamel bonding agents
           and consists of:
            a. Primarily of hydrophobic resin monomers such as BIS-GMA and UDMA.
            b. TEG-DMA as a viscosity regulator.
            c. Hydrophilic monomers like HEMA.

           Mechanism
              (i) The hydrophilic resins present in the primers inﬁltrate the surface layer of collagen
                  ﬁbres in the demineralised dentin to form a hybrid layer consisting of resin-inﬁltrated
                  dentin (Fig 3.61).


             (ii) The primary function of the adhesive resin is to coplymerize with the resins present
                  in the primers thereby stabilizing the hybrid layer.


            (iii) They also form resin extensions into the dentinal tubules called as resin tags (Fig
                  3.62).


             (iv) These resins are then polymerized by light curing and/or auto curing mechanism.


              (v) The surface layer of the adhesive resin is now suitable to be copolymerized with the
                  composite restorative resin.

           Classiﬁcation of Dental Adhesives
              I. According to the chronology of development
             II. According to the bonding mechanism

           I. According to the Chronology of Development
           First generation adhesives
           It was based upon NPG-GMA and was bonded to enamel and dentin by chelation with calcium
           on the tooth surface.

           Second generation adhesives
           These were based on phosphorous esters of methacrylate derivatives and bonding was due to
           the ionic interaction between negatively charged phosphate groups and positively charged
           calcium.

           Third generation adhesives
           The basis of this generation was to modify the smear layer created on the tooth surface with
           the help of agents like EDTA or maleic acid followed by the application of the resin.

           Fourth generation adhesives
           They form part of the etch and rinse group of adhesives.
              The basis of this generation of adhesives was the Total etch concept wherein a speciﬁc
           conditioning/etching of both enamel and dentin was advocated before the application of the
           primer and adhesive agent.

              Inlay wax is a specialized dental wax that can be used for making direct and indirect
           patterns of the tooth prepared for inlays, onlays crowns and bridges, which is later converted
           into cast metal by the lost wax casting technique (Figs 3.71 and 3.72).

           Ideal Requirements
            The wax should be uniform when softened.
            The colour should contrast with the die for better identiﬁcation and ﬁnishing of margins.
            It should not be ﬂaky or rough during moulding after softening.
            The wax pattern should be completely rigid and dimensionally stable.
            It should vaporize completely without residue during burn out.


           Classiﬁcation
           Type I medium wax used for direct technique.
           Type II soft wax used for indirect technique (Figs 3.73 and 3.74).

           I. Connecting the Airotor Handpiece to the Air-Water Line
           The air-water line is attached to the airotor handpiece with the help of a coupling.
           Step 1 → Appreciation of air-water line and airotor nozzle morphology (Fig 4.12).


                           Air line                                                   Base of the

           Fig 4.12 Left: the air-water line consisting of a larger opening which is the air line and one or two
           smaller opening/s which brings in the water line. Right: the connecting end of the airotor handpiece
           which has a larger nozzle for the air line and a smaller one to which the water line is connected


           Step 2 → Retraction of air-water line coupling (Fig 4.13).




                           Air water                                                     Airotor

           Fig 4.13 Keep the air line and water line in alignment with the nozzles at the base of the airotor
           handpiece. The coupling surrounding the top of the air-water line is then gently retracted


           Step 3 → Insertion of air-water line into the handpiece (Fig 4.14).

                                                                                  the airotor
                                                                                  handpiece



           Fig 4.14 Keeping the alignment of the corresponding sized air-water line and the nozzles in the
           handpiece, the air-water line is snugly slided into the handpiece


           Step 4 → Locking the air-water line coupling ((Fig 4.15).




           Fig 4.15 The coupling surrounding the air-water line is then gently pushed forward and then rotated in
           a clockwise direction onto the threads present at the base of the airotor handpiece


           Step 5 → Assessment of the connection (Fig 4.16).




           Fig 4.16 A proper fit is confirmed when the coupling completely covers the threads present on the base
           of the handpiece. Improper fit would lead to water leakage from the back of the handpiece along with
           reduced air pressure

           IV. Placement of Bur into the Latch Type Contra-Angled Handpiece
           Step 1→ Identifying the latch at the back of the contra-angle handpiece (Fig 4.35).




                                                                  Latch at the back
                                                                  of the contra-angled
                                                                  slow speed handpiece




           Fig 4.35 The contra-angled handpiece has a latch which is present on the back side of the head of the
           handpiece


           Step 2 → Opening of the latch (Fig 4.36).




                                                                     Sliding of the

           INTRODUCTION
           Initially, the operator should assess the clinical condition of the tooth and formulate an
           appropriate treatment plan. This involves the proper diagnosis and ﬁnalization of the kind
           of restorative treatment in consultation with the patient’s needs and aspirations.
              The preparation of the tooth structure for a restoration varies according to the kind of
           restorative material being chosen. However, there are certain core fundamental principles
           which an operator has to follow immaterial of the kind of restoration. This chapter would give
           an overview of the basic principles and nomenclatures involved during cavity preparation.

           Cavity Nomenclature (Figs 5.1−5.6)
            External wall: A prepared cavity wall that extends to the cavity margin or the external
             tooth surface.
            Internal wall: A prepared cavity wall that does not extend to the cavity margin or the
             external surface.
            Axial wall: An internal wall parallel to the long axis of the tooth.
            Pulpal ﬂoor/wall: An internal surface of the cavity perpendicular to the long axis of the
             tooth.
            Floor: A Floor or a seat is a prepared wall that is reasonably ﬂat and perpendicular to the
             occlusal forces that are directed occluso-gingivally, e.g. pulpal ﬂoor and gingival seat.
            Line angle: Junction of two planar surface of different orientation along a line.
            Point angle: Junction of three planar surface of different orientation.

                  Class I cavity: line angle-8; point angle-4 (Fig 5.1)
                  Class II cavity: line angle-11; point angle-6 (Fig 5.2)
                  Class III cavity: Proximal approach: line angle-3; point angle-3.
                                     Palatal approach: line angle-5; point angle-2

           INTRODUCTION
           Plaster model exercise deals with preparation of cavities from class I to class V in plaster
           models of different teeth which are three times the size of the natural teeth.
              Cavities are prepared with the help of an enamel chisel and the cavity dimensions are
           measured with a graduated probe (Williams probe).
           These exercises are meant to make the student:
              i. Appreciate the tooth morphology better
             ii. Understand the nomenclature of the cavity walls and surfaces
            iii. Understand the basic principles of cavity preparation including outline, resistance,
                 retention and convenience forms.

           CAVITY PREPARATION

           Deﬁne operative dentistry.
           Operative dentistry is a subject that deals with the diagnosis, prevention and treatment
           of problems and conditions of natural teeth, both vital and nonvital, so as to preserve
           the natural dentition and restore it to the best state of teeth, function and aesthetics
           (Gilmore).
              Operative dentistry is the art and science of the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of
           teeth that do not require full coverage restoration for correction. Such treatment should
           result in the restoration of proper tooth form, function and aesthetics while maintaining
           the physiologic integrity of the teeth in harmonious relationship with the adjacent hard
           and soft tissues, all of which should enhance the general health and welfare of the patient
           (Sturdevant).

           Deﬁne tooth preparation or cavity preparation.
           Tooth preparation or cavity preparation is deﬁned as the mechanical alteration of a defective,
           injured or diseased tooth to best receive a restorative material that will reestablish a healthy
           state for the tooth, including aesthetic corrections where indicated, along with normal form
           and function.

           What are the types of tooth preparation?
              Conventional: A preparation where apart from removal of diseased portion, extension is
               also made so as to include all pits and tissues, unsupported areas to prevent further caries
               formation, for speciﬁc restorations, e.g. amalgam, direct ﬁlling gold, cast restoration.
