                               Foreword

      I am delighted to write the foreword for the second edition of ‘Essentials of Preclinical Conservative
      Dentistry’. This book has been written in order to emphasize the pertinent information which can serve
      the students as a fundamental source of knowledge. The first edition of this book, which was released seven
      years back in 2013 keeping in mind the need to train the undergraduate students efficiently for the subject of
      Preclinical Conservative Dentistry, has been well received by the students and the faculty alike.
          The second edition involves contributions from several faculty members from across the country and
      beyond which for sure has further widened the horizons of this venture. The layout of each chapter includes
      description of the content in a simple, easy to understand language, use of numerous tables, figures and line
      diagrams in immaculate manner, finally concluding with a set of points to remember for a quick revision and
      self-assessment questions to test the reader’s understanding of the subject.
          The contents are arranged in a logical sequential and in a unique presentation with exhaustive coverage of
      the relevant topics which would be useful and advantageous to readers from all the angles. The attention to
      minute details, evident in this book reflects the meticulousness and efficiency of the author.
          It is my hope and expectation that this book will provide an effective learning experience for the preclinical
      students which eventually shall lead to improved patient care in the subsequent years to follow.
          I am certain that this book shall be a valuable tool to reinforce and expand the possibilities of learning
      and teaching.
          I wish Dr Harpreet Singh all that is best for the success of his venture.

                               Preface to the Second Edition

      Sincere thanks to all my seniors, fellow colleagues and dear students for such an overwhelming response to
      the first edition of this book. The response received through mails, letters and verbal communication was a
      perfect combination of praise, suggestions and critics. It is this feedback which drives an author to improvise
      and enhance the product.
          The second edition of Essentials of Preclinical Conservative Dentistry is a revised and modified version of
      its predecessor while staying true to its original motto ‘simple yet effective’. The accented part of this edition
      is the intricate involvement of several eminent teachers from across the country and beyond, who, by their
      knowledge and experience, have contributed in modifying the chapters as well as adding some new ones.
      I am certain that the readers shall be highly benefitted by their expertise in respective topics.
          We have strived to a larger extent to accentuate the number of images, figures, line diagrams and tables
      in order to present the topics in a way which is relatively easier to understand and grasp. The chapter
      ‘Preclinical Conservative Dentistry: The Concept and Its Scope’, supported by illustrations of plaster models
      and typodonts for essential guidance, describes in detail the lab work to be performed by the students.
      A comprehensive compilation of ‘Tooth notation systems’ has also been made for the ease of understanding
      of students. The chapter ‘Infection Control’ provides essential guidelines to the students regarding basic
      sterilisation protocol to be followed. Instruments used in operative dentistry have been described individually
      in the book and are supported by line diagrams and photographs for easy identification and understanding.
          The chapter ‘Patient and Operator Positioning’ describes the ergonomics in dental practice, an essential
      component often overlooked by students in their training programme. The tooth preparations on plaster
      models and typodonts have also been illustrated in a step-by-step procedure for clear understanding and
      easy reproducibility. Tooth preparations have been discussed for silver amalgam, composite and inlay to
      help the students differentiate amongst the three and perform the preparations more efficiently. Numerous
      original pictures and line diagrams have been used for better understanding.
           Matrices, both traditional and recent ones, have been discussed extensively, supported with illustrations
      for better understanding. The step-by-step procedure of placing the amalgam and composite restoration has
      been described in a simplified manner, supported by pictures and illustrations. This can serve as template for
      the students during their exercise work.
          The newly added chapters ‘Dental Chair and Its Components’, ‘Magnification in Restorative Dentistry’,
      ‘Clinical Considerations in Pulp Protection’, ‘Silver Amalgam’ and ‘Casting Procedure and Casting Defects’
      widen the horizon of the book and provide relevant information to our readers.
          I am sure that with all the efforts combined, this new edition shall serve at its best to the students in not
      only empowering them with the basic concepts of Preclinical Conservative Dentistry but also honing their
      clinical skills further in this subject.
          My best wishes to all the students and regards to all the faculty members.

                                                                                                      Harpreet Singh

                                Preface to the First Edition

     This book has its roots in my initial experience of studying conservative dentistry during my undergraduate
     days. As I look back to those undergraduate days, I recollect the plethora of questions about the subject
     whirling around my brain. Questions to which answers were probably simple, seemed difficult because of
     the unavailability of suitable textbooks for easy reference. Borrowing notes from the seniors in order to
     get clarity was the one recourse followed traditionally by everyone, but to me it was never enough. The
     faded photocopied pages were perhaps enough to obtain pass marks but never sufficient to provide a deeper
     understanding. I often wondered how I and my fellow students were expected to get a grip on the subject
     without the help of appropriate textbooks. As days passed, and I graduated with so many unanswered
     questions in mind, the urge to pursue post-graduation in the specialty of conservative dentistry became
     overpowering.
        During post-graduation, I got an opportunity to consolidate my understanding of the specialty through
     clinical practice as well as study of relevant authoritative text and reference literature. This erased all my
     doubts pertaining to the specialty. And now, after teaching and practicing for several years, I feel it is my
     responsibility to put together a simple but effective textbook to help the new entrants to this fascinating
     specialty. Attaining the knowledge from my teachers and several literary textbooks, it undoubtedly became
     my responsibility to feed my mind alike with nutritious diet of simplified text pertaining to the subject.
        The thought of coming out with a separate textbook for preclinical conservative dentistry became
     particularly urgent in my mind as I often noticed that the second year BDS students would generally become
     confused with the basics. I therefore decided to do a brief, but sufficiently intricate, text for them. This
     objective led to the present book.
        I sincerely hope that both students and faculties would find it useful. I would be most grateful for feedback
     for further improvement of the book in its subsequent editions. Good luck!!!

                                                                                                    Harpreet Singh

      An idea is like an abstract seed which requires the sunshine and the manure of the intellect. It also requires
      patience and tender nurturing for it to germinate into a sapling and then into a tree – its ultimate destiny.
          Any piece of creation, whether it represents a dream or its ultimate realisation, owes a humble encomium
      to forces and reasons beyond the more visible.
          My beloved wife, Dr Pooja Kapoor, very much deserves a special thanks. Her enthusiasm and diligence
      were the invaluable ingredients in making of this book. Her unconditional support always motivated me to
      work more and more towards my target. I thank her for being the force and the strength behind me and for
      having stood by me always. Had it not been for her, this book would not have seen the light of the day.
          I owe my sincere gratitude to Dr Vinod Kapoor and Dr (Mrs.) Daljit Kapoor. Not only on professional
      but also on personal grounds I respect them for their simplicity and endearing nature. Their vast knowledge
      and experience has always been a source of inspiration and support for me. Amongst the most approachable
      teachers of my entire academic career, their conscientious approach and humility have taught me more than
      just the subject of Dentistry itself. I will always remain indebted to them for the same.
          I thank Dr Upasna Kapoor for sharing her profound knowledge and showing keen personal interest. Her
      contribution is indeed invaluable.
          Gratitude from the deepest part of my heart to (late) Dr G.K. Meshram Sir, for what I learned in the
      field, I owe it to him. Dr M.M. Warhadpande, Dr V. Gade and Dr V. Kokane deserve special thanks for their
      teachings to me regarding the subject and otherwise.
          I thank my publisher Wolters Kluwer Health (India) for their efforts in meticulously developing the
      manuscript and bringing it out as a high-quality product. In particular, I would like to thank Ms Sangeetha
      Parthasarathy, Dr Harini Swaminathan and Ms Pooja Chauhan for their intense efforts in editing this
      textbook.
          I thank my students for reposing their faith in me.
          Like the proverbial ‘foundation stone’ there will always be people whose contribution despite being so
      magnanimous, unconditional and immeasurable remains invisible and unspoken of. I humbly thank them all.
          I would like to express my everlasting gratitude to my parents for their constant encouragement and
      support. Their affable demeanour has always put me at ease – thus creating the most conducive ambience
      for performing this task.
          And above all – The Almighty. A humble obeisance of my creation to him – from his creation.

              A detailed explanation of all these instruments
         is given in Chapter 7, Instruments in Restorative
         Dentistry.


     Plaster Models
     Plaster models can be used to train the students for
     preclinical work before directly starting on extracted
     natural teeth or typodont teeth. Ready-made moulds
     (Fig. 2.3) are available, which can be poured with
     plaster, and the models of different shapes of teeth
     can be made and worked upon (Figs 2.4–2.6).

      KEY POINTS
      • The course on preclinical conservative dentistry is necessary as it provides the students the initial experience of
        the application of restorative procedures for managing the carious processes.
      • The basic purpose of preclinical conservative dentistry is to make the students work in simulated clinical condi-
        tions in order to train them adequately before they can perform any restorative procedure on the patients.
      • The armamentarium to be used consists of instruments, plaster models, micromotor/air rotor, typodont teeth/
        natural teeth, etc.
      • Use of plaster models can be of great help as these being larger in size help in a better understanding of the
        tooth morphology, anatomy and other intricate details of the preparation procedure.
      • Typodont teeth/extracted natural teeth can be used for exercise work, each type having its own set of advan-
        tages and limitations. It is recommended that extracted teeth be sterilised before use.
      • Use of personal protective equipment is of high importance for prevention of cross-infection and it includes use
        of gloves, mask, eyewear, etc.
      • Computer-assisted preparations can be of great help in future years, which can guide students on a one-to-one
        basis during each step of the preparation procedure.

     • Although the aim of preclinical work exercise is to simulate the clinical conditions as close as possible, certain
       situations such as managing the anxious patients, isolation of tooth from saliva, interference by tongue move-
       ment and limited mouth opening of the patient are encountered only in clinical situations and hence will always
       be the limitation of the laboratory work.

          The basic system of these portable dental units
      includes an operator light source, an examination

      purposes. These portable dental units have a rotary
      instrument and an operator light fixture that is
      packed in two cases.
          More complex portable units may include a

      Handpiece body is mostly made of brass which is
      comparatively a cheap material and easy to use; yet
      it is soft and susceptible to denting. Stainless steel
      is another common choice of material for making
      handpiece bodies. Steel is expensive, but lighter
      and stronger than brass. Nowadays, titanium is also
      considered for making handpiece as it is stronger
      and 40% lighter than stainless steel. More so, it is
      resistant to the corrosive effects of autoclaving.
          The body of the handpiece delivers air and water
      to the handpiece head. This includes drive air (used
      to rotate the turbine), coolant water and chip air
      (mostly used to atomise the water spray). Once the
      drive air is passed through the turbine, it is released
      through the hollow body of the handpiece and down
      the handpiece tubing.

     20       Essentials of Preclinical Conservative Dentistry

     KEY POINTS
     • Dental chair is unquestionably one of the most crucial things in a dental office. The design has evolved since the
       time of its inception way back in the early 1700s.
     • The modern dental chair can be floor-mounted, ceiling-mounted designer and a mobile-independent design.
     • The dental chair can also be a ‘paediatric chair’ specially designed for the children or it could be a ‘standard chair’
       for general use.
     • The dental chair has several parts, each having a specific function to perform. The body of the chair is designed
       so as to provide maximum comfort to the back of the patient during lying-down posture. The ‘head rest’ also can
       be changed in position as per the requirement of the patient.
     • The head light holds the source of light, which can be a halogen bulb or a set of LEDs. A good source of light is
       highly essential for optimal visibility while treating the patient.
     • The bracket table is attached to the arm of the dental chair and is used to keep the instruments which shall be
       used during the dental procedure. Mostly a radiograph film viewer with a light source is attached to it to help
       viewing an intraoral periapical radiograph film.
     • A spittoon is present on the left side of the chair, in order to facilitate rinsing of mouth by the patient. A waterflow
       line is attached to it to ensure that it is kept clean. A disposable cup is usually kept on the cup holder area to
       provide water/mouthwash to the patient for rinsing.
     • A three-way air–water syringe is attached to the chair which can be used as per the requirement. Air–rotor
       handpiece, used for tooth preparation procedure, is attached to air–water pipes which are further attached to a
       compressor.
     • A foot control is used to operate the micromotor/air rotor handpiece as per the need.
     • Dental handpiece is an essential part of a dentist’s armamentarium. It can be air driven, electric handpiece or a
       hybrid air–electric handpiece.
     • Utmost care should be taken in handling the handpiece in order to increase its longevity.

      KEY POINTS
      • Dental notation means providing a unique number to each tooth in the dental arch.
      • Tooth notation system not only helps in easy communication among the dentists and between the dentists and
        the lab technician but also leaves no chance of confusion regarding the tooth being treated.
      • The three most common systems are the Fédération Dentaire Internationale (FDI) notation, the Zsigmondy–
        Palmer notation method and the Universal Numbering System.
      • FDI system designates a tooth by providing a two-digit code. The first number of the code represents the jaw
        quadrant, while the second number represents the tooth in that quadrant.
      • The Zsigmondy–Palmer notation consists of a symbol (     ) designating the quadrant in which the tooth is
        found and a number indicating the position from the midline. Adult teeth are numbered 1–8, with deciduous
        teeth indicated by letters A–E.
      • In the Universal Numbering System, teeth are numbered from 1 to 32, 1 being the right maxillary third molar and
        16 being the left maxillary third molar; 17 is the left mandibular third molar and then the number goes up to 32
        for the right mandibular third molar.
      • Other numbering systems used in different parts of the world are dental notation by Dane and Haderup, dental
        notation system in Holland, dental notation system in South Africa, the army dental notation system, the navy
        dental notation system, the Bosworth system, etc.
      • The supernumerary teeth associated with permanent teeth can be designated by simply adding 50 to the
        existing number of the tooth; for example, supernumerary tooth close to tooth number 1 is designated as 51.
        Supernumerary teeth associated with deciduous teeth can be designated by writing ‘S’ after the closest decid-
        uous tooth; for example, one close to tooth B is written as BS.



      SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
      1. What is the need of tooth nomenclature/notations?
      2. What do you mean by the FDI nomenclature system?
      3. How do you notate the teeth in the Zsigmondy–Palmer notation system?
      4. Explain the details of the Universal Numbering System.
      5. How will you notate a supernumerary tooth present in the dentition?

     The word ‘caries’ is derived from the Latin word

     According to Sturdevant                                              proposed as an explanation for the aetiology
     ‘Dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease                of dental caries, such as ‘the legend of worms’,

     KEY POINTS
     • Dental caries is an infectious microbiological disease of the teeth that results in localised dissolution and
       destruction of the calcified tissues.
     • Many theories have been proposed which explain the aetiology of dental caries. However, the most widely
       accepted is the ‘chemicoparasitic theory’ proposed by Miller in 1889.
     • Other theories proposed are proteolytic theory, sulphatase theory, proteolysis chelation theory, Levine’s theory
       and Burch and Jackson hypothesis.
     • Keyes, in 1960, proposed dental caries to be a multifactorial disease in which there is interplay of three principal
       factors: a susceptible host tissue (tooth), microflora with a cariogenic potential (bacteria) and a suitable local
       substrate (diet). This is called caries triad.
     • Newbrun, in 1982, proposed to add a fourth factor ‘time’ in the existing triad and hence the term ‘caries tetrad’
       came into existence.
     • Carious lesion in the enamel, as seen histopathologically, shows the translucent zone, dark zone, body zone and
       surface zone.
     • Carious lesion in the dentin, as seen histopathologically, shows the normal dentin, subtransparent dentin,
       transparent dentin, turbid dentin and infected dentin.

      • Various terminologies, such as pit and fissure caries, smooth surface caries, cervical caries, root caries, acute
        dental caries, rampant caries, nursing bottle caries and chronic dental caries, need to be understood for clinical
        reference and their management thereafter.
      • Diagnosis of presence of dental caries can be made by careful clinical and radiographic examination. Undue use
        of sharp explorer is not recommended.
      • Use of recent diagnostic tools such as the ‘DIAGNOdent’ can be of immense help, especially in the diagnosis of
        early dental caries.
      • Preventive therapy must always be given due consideration, understanding the fact that caries is a dynamic
        process comprising the demineralisation–remineralisation cycle, wherein altering the oral environment can tip
        the balance in favour of remineralisation and away from demineralisation.
      • Diet control, plaque control, usage of fluoride and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, etc., can help in remineralisation
        of non-cavitated lesions.

      KEY POINTS
      • Classification of cavities holds paramount importance in restorative dentistry, as it depicts the exact site of
        carious involvement in a tooth. This helps in easy record keeping as well.
      • G.V. Black proposed the first classification system according to the tooth surface involved and coined the terms
        Class I, II, III, IV and V.
      • Simon added another class to the existing classification and designated it as Class VI.
      • Cavity classification system based on the lesion site and size was proposed by G.J. Mount and W.R. Hume in 1997.
        This classification is linked to the stage of progression of lesion and is not related to cavity design.
      • In 2009, ICDAS was introduced based on the initiation and progression of dental caries. It categorises the carious
        lesions as (a) caries on smooth surface and pit and fissures, (b) caries associated with restoration and sealants
        and (c) caries on root surface.
      • The classification system based on the radiographical changes in the proximal lesions was given by Ben and
        Dankel et al. This classification divides the carious lesions depending on the fact that they involve only the
        enamel or extend into the dentin as well, when observed radiographically.

         face and the clearance face. Increasing the edge
         angle reinforces the cutting edge and reduces the
         chances of fracture of the blade edge.                          Figure 7.40   Diamond point.

      Classification
      The diamond abrasives can be classified according
      to shape and particle size:
      1. According to shape
        (a) Round
        (b) Football
        (c) Barrel

        (g) Flame-shaped
        (h) Pear-shaped
      2. According to diamond particle size
        (a) Coarse (150–180 µm)
        (b) Medium (107–120 µm)
        (c) Fine (50–60 µm)
        (d) Extra-fine (30–40 µm)

      Colour Coding of Burs
      Diamond points are usually colour coded depending       A
      on their coarseness and fineness. This helps in their
      easy identification during clinical usage. There is
      a coloured band present on the bur, for example,
      green for coarse, blue for medium, red for fine and
      yellow for extra-fine.                                  B

      Other Abrasive Instruments
      Many types of abrasive instruments are used in
      dentistry in addition to diamond instruments. They      Figure 7.42 Finishing/polishing (A) discs and (B) strips.

      KEY POINTS
      • Instruments in conservative dentistry are an essential component, and therefore one must clearly understand
        the identification and usage of each instrument.
      • It is essential that the instruments be laid in the working area in a sequential manner according to their usage
        during the operative procedure so as to have an uninterrupted work flow.
      • The hand instruments can be made of carbon steel, stainless steel or other alloys.
      • Three parts of a dental instrument are handle, shank and blade.
      • Cutting instruments have formulas describing the dimensions and angles of the working end. The complete
        instrument formula (four numbers) is expressed as the blade width (1) in 0.1-mm increments, cutting edge angle
        (2) in centigrades, blade length (3) in millimetres and blade angle (4) in centigrades.
      • It is essential that the instrument be grasped in a correct manner to achieve the adequate working efficiency. The
        various grasps used with hand instruments are modified pen grasp, inverted pen grasp, palm-and-thumb grasp
        and modified palm-and-thumb grasp.
      • Rests, used during instrumentation, are referred to as areas used to keep the hand steady during instrumenta-
        tion. Finger rests may be intraoral or extraoral.
      • Only sharp instruments should be used for cutting purpose during tooth preparation procedure. For sharpening
        of cutting instruments, sharpening stones are used.
      • Rotary cutting instruments are used with slow speed or high speed, with latter being preferred.
      • A bur is a rotary cutting instrument, which has a bladed cutting head. Each bur consists of three parts: shank,

      • Diamond abrasive instruments are based on small, angular particles of a hard substance held in the matrix of a
        softer material.
      • Diamond instruments consist of three parts: a metal blank, powdered diamond abrasive and a metallic bonding
        material that holds the diamond powder onto the blank.
      • Hazards during tooth preparation must be taken into serious account and necessary measures must be taken to
        avoid these as far as possible.
      • Pulp can be damaged during tooth preparation due to various reasons, for example, excessive mechanical vibra-
        tion transferred to the tooth, heat generation and dessication.

     • Intraoral soft tissues of the patient vulnerable to injury during tooth preparation include the lips, tongue and
       cheek mucosa.
     • Eyes of the patient, operator and assistant are prone to injury because of the risk of contamination from the
       air-borne particles produced during rotary instrumentation.
     • Aerosols and vapours created by cutting tooth structure and restorative materials can also be hazardous.

     than the normal one. This will help them in several
     ways:
     1. Under magnification, the students can better
        visualise and understand the anatomy of the
        tooth (Fig. 8.9).
     2. It is easier for the students to understand all
        the line angles and point angles, when they are
        seeing their preparations under magnification,
        while working under loupes.
     3. Since the student can see the tooth bigger, there
        are fewer chances of the base material sticking to
        side walls of the cavity during base application.
     4. Carving the anatomy of the tooth after resto-            Figure 8.9 Student performing the               pre-clinical

        working under magnification as intricate details
        can be reproduced.


     KEY POINTS
     • It holds true that if we can see better, we can treat better. Therefore, in this era of modern dentistry, treating
       under magnification is highly essential.
     • The students, from the beginning itself, must be trained to work under magnification, whenever feasible.
     • The two systems used for magnification in dentistry are dental loupes and dental operating microscope.
     • Loupes are easily available, more economical and comparatively easier to use. However, their magnification
       levels are limited from 1.5× to 4× usually.
     • The dental operating microscope is a considerably elaborate equipment, which can magnify the tooth up to
       40× or more. The coaxial illumination also provides a better field of view in the microscopes. So, working under
       it proves to be more efficient as compared to loupes. However, it is highly expensive and there is a long learning
       curve before one can master working under it.
     • Students, at the level of pre-clinical conservative dentistry, must train themselves working under loupes, for they
       can better understand the anatomy of the tooth when seeing it larger and also perform their preparations and
       restoration in a more efficient manner.



     SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
     1. Name the two systems which are commonly used for magnification in dentistry.
     2. What are the advantages and limitations of using dental loupes?
     3. What are the advantages and limitations of using dental operating microscope?
     4. Enumerate the advantages of using loupes in pre-clinical conservative dentistry.

     1. Endodontic instruments can be cleansed of
        debris by squeezing the instrument blade with
        gauze moistened with isopropyl alcohol, while
        withdrawing the instrument, rotating in an
        anticlockwise motion (Fig. 9.3).
     2. Quaternary ammonium compounds are effec-
        tive against vegetative bacteria while isopropyl
        alcohol is effective against tubercle bacilli.
     3. Glutaraldehyde (Korsolex®) can be used for both
        disinfection and sterilisation. However, its use as
        a sterilising agent is not much recommended.
     4. It is recommended that dappen dishes be ster-

        bing is always done by applying some pressure
        (Fig. 9.4).
     5. Tweezers can be sterilised by dipping their
        working point in isopropyl alcohol and flaming
        twice. This method is an auxiliary method and
        used when already sterilised instruments have
        become infected intraoperatively (Fig. 9.5).
     6. To sterilise the gutta-percha cone, it should be
        immersed in 5.2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)
        for 1 minute, and then rinsed with hydrogen
        peroxide (H2O2) and dried between two layers
        of sterile gauze pieces. Also, one can use 0.5%
        NaOCl for 5 minutes (Fig. 9.6).

     Radiations
     Radiations used for sterilisation are of two types:
     ionising and non-ionising radiations

     Ionising Radiations
     Ionising radiations such as gamma rays have great
     penetrating properties and are commonly used at
     the industrial level for sterilisation of disposable
     items such as syringes and gloves.
        There is no appreciable rise in tempera-                              B
     ture. High-energy gamma rays from Co-60 and
     caesium-137 are commonly used.

     Non-Ionising Radiations
     These include UV rays and infrared rays.
     1. UV rays: These are absorbed by proteins and
        nucleic acids and kill microbes by the chemical
        reactions that are set up in the bacterial cell.
        These have low-penetrating capacity and their
        main application is for purification of air in the
        operating rooms or for surface sterilisation, as
        for handpieces. All forms of bacteria and viruses
        are vulnerable to UV rays below 3000 atmo-

          Clinical Waste and its Disposal
      Clinical waste is:
      1. Any waste that consists wholly or partly of
          human or animal tissue, blood or other body
          fluids, excretions, drugs or other pharmaceutical
          products, soiled swabs or dressings or syringes,
          needles or other sharp instruments, being waste
          which, unless rendered safe, may prove to be
          hazardous to any person coming into contact
          with it
      2. Any other waste arising from medical, nursing,
          dental, veterinary, pharmaceutical or similar

      KEY POINTS
      • Microorganisms cause contamination, infection and decay; therefore, it becomes necessary to remove or destroy
        them from materials or from areas.
      • Sterilisation is defined as a process by which an article, a surface or a medium is freed of all microbes either in
        vegetative or in spore state.
      • Disinfection is a process that reduces the number of viable microbes to an acceptable level, but may not inactivate
        some viruses and bacterial spores.
      • Cleansing agents such as soaps and detergents are used prior to sterilisation.
      • Chemicals used for disinfection and sterilisation include alcohols, aldehydes, halogens and phenols.
      • Hot air oven uses the principle of dry heat for sterilisation. A holding period of 160°C for 1 hour is recommended.
        To test its efficiency, spores of non-toxic strain of Clostridium tetani can be used.
      • For sterilisation with ‘steam under pressure’, an autoclave is the best device used. The cycle for this is set at 121°C
        at 15 psi for 15 minutes. For the monitoring of sterilisation in autoclave, several tests can be used, e.g. autoclave
        tape test, Brown’s test or spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus can be used.
      • For gas sterilisation, ethylene oxide is commonly used, while among radiations, gamma, UV rays and IR are
        employed.
      • Glass bead steriliser is used for sterilisation of endodontic files. It works at a temperature between 425°F and
        475°F.
      • PPE such as gloves, protective eye wear, masks, head caps and protective overgarments must be worn.
      • Regulations have been laid down regarding the disposal of sharps and soft waste disposal and they must be
        adhered to. Coloured bags with specifications for disposal of clinical waste have been recommended and must
        be used accordingly.
      • Handpiece can be sterilised by autoclaving, by wrapping in gauze soaked with a disinfectant or by use of dispos-
        able disinfectant sleeves.
      • Before sterilisation of handpiece, one must ensure that it is completely dried and lubricated properly using
        commercially available lubricants. Once this is done, the handpiece is bagged in a sterilisation pouch and
        autoclaved.
      • DUWSs may harbour microbes that usually colonise on the inner surfaces of the water tubings, resulting in
        microbial accumulations termed ‘biofilms’. Therefore, it is necessary to keep these tubings clean.
      • As an essential pre-requisite, any staff working in a healthcare facility who handles sharps or clinical waste
        should receive a full course of hepatitis B vaccine and have his/her antibody level checked on a regular basis.
      • If PEP is indicated, it should be started as soon as possible after the incident and ideally within an hour.

     of the time-to-time requirement of the operator,
     and, accordingly, the instrument/material should be
     passed on to him or her by the assistant. In addition,
     the maintenance of adequate isolation by the use of
     suction by the assistant should not be jeopardised.
     The sharp instruments should be transferred very
     carefully. The assistant must always keep the sharp
     end of the instrument towards him or her and pass
     on the blunt side towards the dentist in order to avoid
     any inadvertent injury. When performing a proce-
     dure that requires continuous monitoring of the site
     by the assistant, as in surgical cases, a third assistant
     can be of help in passing the desired instruments,
     adjusting light of the dental unit, etc. In such a case,    Figure 10.12 Dental operating microscope being used to

      KEY POINTS

      • Correct operator and patient positioning is a must, as it helps to have adequate visibility and accessibility to the
        surgical site and also prevents operator and patient fatigue and discomfort.
      • The patient should have direct access to the dental chair when asked to sit for dental treatment. The backrest can
        be tilted from 15° to 45° depending on the patient’s comfort and the operator’s requirement.
      • As far as the operator is concerned, the dental stool should be so adjusted that one is comfortable and the body
        posture is correct.
      • Unit light should be kept at an arm’s length above or in front of the patient.
      • The position of the bracket table should be low enough to permit a clear view of the instruments.
      • For instrumentation in the mandibular area, the patient should have his or her mouth open in a chin-down
        position, with the mandibular occlusal surfaces oriented at about 45° to the floor.
      • When working on the teeth in the maxillary arch, the occlusal surfaces of the teeth should be perpendicular to
        the floor.
      • Operating positions for the right-handed and the left-handed operators are usually identified in relation to a
        12-hour clock, namely right front position (8 o’clock position), right position (9 o’clock position), right rear posi-
        tion (10 and 11 o’clock positions) and direct rear position (12 o’clock position).

     • While assisting, the assistant should sit on a stool in such a way that his or her horizontal level is higher than that
       of the dentist. This helps in better visibility of the working area and thus better assistance.
     • Use of magnification loupes and dental operating microscope can help in increasing the efficiency of the
       operator.
     • Use of indirect vision is recommended for the operator whenever appropriate to avoid any musculoskeletal
       disorder.
     • Instruments should be laid out in the working area in such a manner that they are easily accessible to the
       operator without much of movement.

     6. As a part of the treatment plan for other restor-
         ative procedures, for example, a tooth adjacent
         to a missing tooth may require some treatment
         before placing a bridge, in which it acts as an
         abutment
        It should be clearly understood that restorative
     intervention primarily repairs damage caused by
     caries and by itself does not rid the patient of the
     factors that caused the disease initially.

     Cavity
     According to Sturdevant, the term cavity refers
     to a defect in the enamel or in the enamel and the
     dentin, resulting from a pathological process, dental
     caries. Once the carious process has invaded tooth
     tissue significantly, the only effective treatment          Figure 11.2   Compound cavity.
     for preventing its further progress is the complete
     removal of the infected area.
         Into the void that remains, a restoration is placed,
     which is durable and compatible with both the tooth
     and its supporting tissues. The health, form, func-
     tions and aesthetics (wherever applicable) are thus
     restored.

     Classification
     A cavity can be classified according to the number
     of surfaces involved or based on the type of surface
     involved.
     1. According to the number of surfaces involved
       (a) Simple cavities: These involve one surface, for
           example, labial, lingual and occlusal (Fig. 11.1).

       (b) Compound cavities: These involve two
           surfaces, for example, mesio-occlusal cavity
           and disto-occlusal cavity (Fig. 11.2).                  (c) Complex cavities: These involve three or more
                                                                       surfaces, for example, mesio-occluso-distal

                                                                 2. According to the type of surfaces involved

         Outline Form
     Preparing the outline form refers to the following:
     1. Placing the cavity margins in a position they will
        occupy in the final restoration
     2. Preparing an initial depth of 0.2–0.8 mm below
        the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ).

     There are certain factors that govern/dictate the
     outline form of the tooth preparation in the tooth
     involved, such as the following:
     1. The extent: The size of the carious lesion, defect
         or faulty old restoration affects the outline form.
     2. Position of pits and fissures: The outline forms
         of various teeth can be described as follows:

     There is a set of rules that governs whether the cusps

     1. If the extension of cavity preparation from the
         primary groove towards the cusp tip is less than
         half the distance (measured from the primary
         groove up to the cusp tip in unprepared tooth),
         then no cusp capping is required.
     2. If this extension is from one-half to two-thirds of
         the distance, then cusp capping is considered.                 Figure 11.20 Box-shaped cavity with a flat floor.

         Removal of any Remaining Enamel
         Pit/Fissure or Infected Dentin/
         Old Restorative Material
     It is the elimination of any infected carious tooth
     structure or faulty restorative material left in the
     tooth structure after initial tooth preparation.
     Principles
     1. In this context, it is essential to understand the
        difference between infected dentin and affected
        dentin and its clinical significance. Infected
        dentin is dark brown in colour and soft, and
        must be removed because it is bacteria laden.
        The collagen in the infected dentin is irrevers-
        ibly denatured. On the other hand, the affected
                                                                    Figure 11.28 Caries detector dye.
        dentin is light brown in colour, relatively hard
        and free from bacteria. Also, the collagen in
        the affected dentin is reversibly denatured.                   this carious portion should be removed, leaving

     3. Amalgam pins refer to placement of amalgam
        in areas deepened, especially at specific sites,
        to help ensure the retention of silver amalgam.
        This procedure is usually applied in large resto-
        rations, wherein cylindrical pits are made in the                                                            DEJ

        retention of the bulky restoration and are termed
        amalgam pins.

      KEY POINTS
      • Tooth preparation is the mechanical alteration of a tooth to receive a restorative material that will return the
        tooth and the infected area to proper form, function and aesthetics.
      • Line angle can be defined as the junction of two planar surfaces while point angle is a junction of three planar
        surfaces.
      • Principles of tooth preparation are as follows: establishing the outline form; establishing the resistance form;
        establishing the retention form; convenience form; removal of any remaining enamel pit/fissure and/or old
        restorative material if indicated; pulp protection; secondary resistance and retention form; procedures for
        finishing external walls; and cleaning, inspecting, varnishing and conditioning of the cavity.
      • Establishing the outline form means placing the cavity margins in a position that they will occupy in the final
        restoration and preparing an initial depth of 0.2–0.8 mm below the DEJ.




                                               https://t.me/DentalBooksWorld

     124      Essentials of Preclinical Conservative Dentistry

     • Primary resistance form is defined as the shape and placement of tooth preparation walls that best enable both
       the restoration and the tooth to withstand, without fracture, masticatory forces delivered principally along the
       long axis of the tooth.
     • Primary retention form is defined as that shape or form of tooth preparation that resists displacement or removal
       of the restoration from tipping or lifting forces.
     • Convenience form is that form or shape of cavity that provides for adequate observation, accessibility and ease
       of operation in preparing and restoring the tooth.
     • Removal of remaining enamel pit/fissure or the infected dentin/restorative material refers to the elimination of
       any infected carious tooth structure or faulty restorative material left in the tooth structure after initial tooth
       preparation.
     • Pulp protection refers to the placement of cavity varnish/liner/base, depending on the depth of the prepared
       cavity.
     • Secondary resistance and retention features are incorporated in preparations where it seems that primary resis-
       tance and retention features would not be sufficient in placing a successful restoration. Retention locks, grooves
       and coves can be utilised. Enamel and dentin conditioning can also be done.
     • Finishing the external walls is the next step, wherein a specific cavosurface design and degree of smoothness is
       indicated that produces maximum effectiveness of the restorative material being used.
     • The final procedure of inspecting and varnishing includes cleaning of cavity, inspecting the tooth preparation
       and applying varnish when indicated.
     • These general guidelines help the operator to ensure adequate preparation of the tooth structure so that it can
       best retain the restorative material being used. Not all the principles would be applicable in every case, as their
       requirement is based on the extent of dental caries, the surface of tooth involved, the type of restorative material
       being used, etc. Nevertheless, these principles when taken into consideration during the procedure guide the
       operator to achieve optimal results.

     general, the rule that is followed for cusp capping is
     as follows:
     1. If the outline form has extended half the distance
         from the primary groove to a cusp tip, cusp
         capping has to be considered, but if the exten-
         sion is two-third or more, the cusp capping is
         mandatory.
     2. Reduction is done in the initial stages of tooth
         preparation because it becomes a part of the             Figure 12.37 (A) MOD preparation of a maxillary first
         convenience form.                                        molar on a typodont tooth. (B) Schematic representation.
     3. Depth gauge cuts are made at a depth of 2 mm
         for functional cusps, and 1.5 mm for non-func-           6. Since cusp reduction decreases the retention
         tional cusps, using the side of a carbide fissure           form, additional features such as slots and
         bur (Fig. 12.38).                                           potholes can be given.
     4. The flattening is then done, moving the bur side-         7. Pins can also be used to increase the retention
         ways (Fig. 12.39).                                          form when cusp capping is performed.
     5. Any sharp corners, if present, should be rounded          8. The tooth is then restored after placing matrix
         to improve the resistance form.                             band and retainer (Fig. 12.40).

     features are usually required in Class III prepara-
     tions for silver amalgam.

     Final Tooth Preparation
     Removal of the remaining infected dentin is done
     at this stage by using a sharp spoon excavator or
     a large round bur at slow speed. Pulp protection
     is performed thereafter with appropriate use of
     varnish/liner/base (refer Chapter 11, Principles of
     Tooth Preparation).
        Secondary retention form can be achieved by the
     use of the following:
     1. Gingival retention groove: No. 1/4 bur is kept
         at the axiofaciogingival point angle and moved             Figure 12.46 Placing the incisal retention cove.
         lingually along the axiogingival line angle,
         cutting mostly gingivally and slightly pulpally.
         Depth of the groove is kept 0.25 mm (Fig. 12.45).
     2. Incisal retention cove: It is given with No. 1/4
         bur at the axioincisal point angle in the dentin
         and it is kept 0.25 mm deep (Fig. 12.46).
     3. Modification in the conventional Class III
         preparation—lingual dovetail: This is reserved
         for large preparations only and prepared when
         the proximal box is complete. It is usually not
         extended beyond the mesiodistal midpoint of the
         lingual surface, and pulpal depth is about 1 mm.
         A No. 245 bur is placed perpendicular to the
         lingual surface and preparation is done by moving
         the bur up to the final extension limit (Figs 12.47
         and 12.48). The bur is then moved incisally and
         gingivally, and all walls are smoothened and               Figure 12.47 Bur placed in position for preparing lingual

     KEY POINTS
     • Class I restorations are the restorations on the occlusal surface of premolars and molars, on the occlusal two-thirds
       of the facial and the lingual surfaces of molars and on the lingual surfaces of maxillary incisors.
     • Class I preparation is done using No. 245 bur. The bur is held parallel to the long axis of the tooth throughout the
       procedure. The preparation is made 1.5–2 mm deep. Dovetails are given for achieving the retention form. The
       cavity is made like a box which has a flat pulpal floor and all line angles and point angles are rounded off.
     • For Class I cavity preparation on the maxillary molar with palatal extension, after the occlusal preparation, the
       bur is moved towards the palatal fissure; while doing this, the long axis of the bur is kept parallel to the palatal
       surface and the tip of the bur is located at the gingival extent of the palatal fissure. After this, the bur is oriented
       with its long axis perpendicular to the axial wall to accentuate the mesioaxial and the distoaxial line angles.
     • For a Class II preparation on a maxillary premolar, outline form for occlusal portion is the same as for Class I. After
       that, the preparation is extended proximally to make a proximal box. The gingival floor of this box should be
       below the contact point with the adjacent tooth. The facial and lingual walls of the box should be converging
       occlusally to provide retention form. The axiopulpal line angle is also rounded off.
     • Class III restorations are the restorations on the proximal surfaces of the anterior teeth that do not involve the
       incisal angle.
     • While preparing cavity on the distal surface of a mandibular canine, the carious lesion is entered with No. 2 round
       bur from lingual side, and a pulpal depth of 0.5–0.6 mm of the DEJ is recommended.
     • The facial, gingival and incisal walls are kept perpendicular to the axial wall. However, the lingual wall is kept at
       an obtuse angle to the axial wall.
     • Gingival retention groove is made using No. 1/4 bur.
     • Incisal retention cove can be given at the axioincisal point angle using No. 1/4 bur.
     • Lingual dovetail is made for large preparations only.
     • Class V restorations are present on the gingival one-third of the facial and lingual surfaces of all teeth.
     • While preparing cavity on the cervical third of a mandibular canine, a tapered/straight fissure bur is used to enter
       the lesion site to have a pulpal depth of 0.5 mm from the DEJ.
     • The alignment of the bur is changed according to the wall being prepared to ensure that all the external walls are
       finally placed perpendicular to the external tooth surface.
     • At the end of the preparation, axial wall should follow the contour of the facial surface.
     • Retention grooves can be placed at incisoaxial and axiogingival line angles or retention coves can be placed at
       all the four-point angles to enhance the retention form.
     • Class VI preparations are made very conservatively in order to prevent any undermining of the enamel. A small
       bur such as No. 169L is used to perform this procedure. Depth of the preparation is kept at 1.5 mm and at times
       undercuts are given to enhance the retention form.

       Clinical Tips for Using Tofflemire Matrix
       1. If the gingival extension of the proximal portion of the cavity preparation is more apically located than the gingival
          tissue, both facially and lingually, there is a danger of cutting the gingival tissues facially and lingually while using a
          band with a straight gingival edge. In this situation, it is necessary to reduce the occlusal–apical width of the band
          facially and lingually or to use a band with apical projections that coincide and cover the gingival extension of the
          proximal portion of the cavity preparation.
       2. In preparation with subgingival margins, especially at the axial angles or any surface protrusion of the tooth, the
          edges of the band occasionally encounter the gingival margin and become bent inwards, preventing further seating
          of the band. For this reason, there should be unprepared, exposed tooth surface apical to the gingival margin of the
          preparation to support the band in its apical path and to prevent its inward collapse or bending. This may necessitate
          gingival retraction or cutting.
       3. Although it is preferable to put the retainer in the buccal vestibule, parallel to the adjacent teeth (Fig. 13.4), some-
          times, due to shallow sulcus or sizable buccal involvement of the tooth in preparation, the retainer is placed on the
          lingual side. This usually necessitates a contra-angled retainer.
       4. However, a retainer should never be placed at right angles to the facial or the lingual surface of the teeth that are
          operated upon, as this will drastically change the occlusoapical contour of the band.
       5. As soon as the band (available in 0.001, 0.0015 and 0.002 gauges) is in place and all cavity margins can be seen inside
          the matrix, a wedge, comparable with the dimensions of the future gingival embrasure, is chosen and placed (always
          from the opposite side of the retainer attachment). The golden rule, however, is to place the wedge from the buccal
          side in the mandibular premolars and molars and from the palatal side in the maxillary premolars and molars, since
          these corresponding embrasures are relatively large and allow easy placement of the wedge.
       6. A ball burnisher can be used from within the cavity preparation to shape the matrix material in order to create the
          outline of the contact and the contour of the future restoration.
       7. After the insertion and initial hardening and manipulation of the restorative material, the wedges are removed. Then,
          the retainer is loosened and disengaged. The band is bent against the adjacent tooth surfaces and removed from
          between the teeth in an occlusal direction, while being pressed against the adjacent tooth. If the contact area is
          extremely tight and the band is resistant to removal, the band is cut on the opposite side of the retainer and then
          pulled buccolingually, with pressure against the adjacent tooth.

        To stabilise the band and prevent cervical flashes
     of amalgam, wedges and impression compounds are
     placed.

     Anatomical Matrix
     (Compound-Supported Matrix)
     Anatomical matrix is considered as one of the best
     matrices, since it is entirely custom-made and can be
     contoured specifically for individual tooth. It is very
     beneficial for those teeth that have wide contact area
     loss due to caries.
     Procedure
     A piece of stainless steel matrix band is drawn between
     the handles of a pair of festooning scissors. This
     procedure facilitates the adaptation of the free ends of
     the matrix to the proximal surface of the tooth.
        The matrix band is cut to proper length and is
     contoured with contouring pliers. It is then trimmed
     appropriately.                                              Figure 13.8 Anatomical matrix (compound-supported

     Transparent Plastic Matrix Strips
     These are used in teeth to be restored with restor-
     ative materials such as composite resins, as they are
     transparent (Fig. 13.11) and allow the curing light to
     pass through them; therefore, they do not interfere
     with the resin polymerisation.
        For composite resins, cellophane strips are usually
                                                                            Contoured area for interproximal contact
     used. Mylar strips can also be used.

     Matrix for Class III Preparations
     The suitable plastic strip is burnished over the
     end of a steel instrument, for example, handle of
     tweezers, to produce a ‘belly’ in the strip. This will
     allow for curvature which, if properly contoured
     and designed, will reproduce the natural proximal                      B
     contour of the tooth.

     Procedure
     Figure 13.12A (from down to top) represents the
     step-by-step procedure of making and placing of
     the matrix in Class III preparations. Figure 13.12B
     shows the clinical placement of transparent plastic
     matrix in class III restoration.

         as the length of the tooth.
     2. The corners of the strip should be trimmed
         to allow for better adaptation to the tooth and               to prevent any excess material from forming on

            material is being placed in the cavity.

      Matrices for Class IV Preparations
      Class IV restorations are considered as one of the
      difficult ones to perform especially because of
      aesthetic considerations involved and the fact that                        A                             B
      anatomic details need to be reproduced as close
      as possible to the missing natural tooth structure.
      Therefore, it is highly essential to train oneself for
      the correct placement of matrices in these situations
      in order to obtain desired results.

      dure of placing the matrix in class IV preparations.

           an L-shape (Fig. 13.13A,B).
      2. One side of the strip is cut so that it is as wide as
           the length of the tooth.
      3. The other side is cut so that it is as wide as the
           width of the tooth.

              With the invention of newer sectional matrices,
        ‘flexible wedges’ are now available (Fig. 13.22),
        which can adapt flexibly according to the space
        available in the interdental region. These wedges
        adapt the band to the tooth structure very precisely
        and thus are becoming very popular among clini-
        cians world over.

      KEY POINTS
      • Matricing is the procedure in which a temporary wall is created (by using a band) in the area of lost tooth struc-
        ture, so as to achieve proper contour of the tooth when restoration is done.
      • Ivory matrix No. 1 is used for Class II restorations while No. 8 is used for Class I with buccal or palatal extension
        and at times for MOD restorations.
      • Tofflemire is the most commonly used matrix, especially for Class II cases, owing to its easy application and
        removal. It is also known as universal matrix.
      • The anatomical matrix (compound-supported matrix) is the most efficient means of reproducing contacts and
        contour. It is entirely handmade and contoured specifically for each individual case.
      • AutoMatrix is a retainerless matrix system and can be used in patients who cannot tolerate the retainer in their
        mouth.
      • Transparent plastic matrix strips are used in cases where teeth are to be restored with composite resins, as these
        matrices allow the curing light to pass and thus allow complete polymerisation of the composite.
      • Window matrix is formed using either a Tofflemire or a copper band matrix, and is used in restoring Class V
        cavities mainly with silver amalgam.
      • Pre-formed transparent cervical matrices are used while restoring Class V cavities with GIC or composite resins.
      • Sectional matrices are now available that do not have very long retainers hanging out. These provide natural
        contours and profiles as they are malleable and can be properly adapted to the remaining tooth structure.
      • Wedge is a piece of soft wood or plastic that is used to adapt the matrix band against the tooth structure. This
        helps to prevent extrusion of the restorative material into the gingival crevice at the time of compaction.
      • Wedges can be round or triangular in shape, and can be made of wood, plastic, etc.

         Cavity Varnish
     Cavity varnish is described as a natural gum, copal
     or resin dissolved in an organic solvent such as chlo-
     roform acetone or ether.
     Functions
     The cavity varnish acts as a barrier and prevents
     penetration of oral fluids into the underlying dentin
     from the tooth–restoration interface. Cavity varnish
     is indicated for the following purposes:
     • Inhibit microleakage under the restoration
     • Prevent penetration of corrosion by-products (e.g.
         amalgam blues) into the underlying tooth structure
     • Inhibit acid penetration into dentinal tubules
     • Seal the dentinal tubules temporarily
     • Prevent post-operative sensitivity                        Figure 14.1   Cavity varnish.

      Clinical Considerations

      KEY POINTS
      • Pulp protection forms one of the crucial steps while performing restoration of a tooth.
      • Three basic categories of pulp protecting agents are cavity varnishes, liners and bases.
      • Cavity varnish is nothing but natural gum, copal or resin dissolved in an organic solvent such as chloroform
        acetone or ether. It should be applied on all the cavity walls using a brush or an applicator tip in 2–3 layers in a
        thickness of 5–10 µm.
      • Its use is contraindicated under composite resin restorations and under glass ionomer cement.
      • Cavity liners are thin layers of specific materials which are used to provide a barrier to protect the dentin. These
        are usually an aqueous or volatile suspension or dispersion of zinc oxide or calcium hydroxide or glass ionomer,
        applied in a thickness of ≤0.5 mm. A liner may be applied only on the deepest part of the cavity, where it is
        required.
      • Calcium hydroxide helps in the formation of reparative dentin; zinc oxide eugenol provides the obtundent effect
        and glass ionomer cement provides fluoride release and chemical adhesion to the underlying dentin.
      • Bases provide physical, mechanical, chemical, thermal and electrical protection to the dental pulp and are
        applied in a thickness of at least 0.75 mm.

     • Zinc phosphate cement, reinforced zinc oxide eugenol cement, glass ionomer cement, zinc polycarboxylate
       cement, MTA and Biodentin are the commonly used bases.
     • A base is applied on the entire pulpal floor or the axial wall.



     SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
     1. What is a cavity varnish? Discuss its indications and contraindications.
     2. Define cavity liner. Describe the exact function of calcium hydroxide and zinc oxide eugenol, when used as a
        liner.
     3. What is the thickness of an ideal base? Name the walls of Class II cavity where you would apply the base.
     4. Describe the various functions of a base.

      Silver amalgam alloy consists of silver, tin, copper              1800: D’Arcet made the first silver amalgam alloy

     180      Essentials of Preclinical Conservative Dentistry

     KEY POINTS
     •    Silver amalgam is one of the oldest restorative materials used in dental practice.
     •    It basically comprises silver alloy powder particles which are mixed with mercury to make the silver amalgam.
     •    Silver alloy powder comprises silver, tin, copper, zinc, platinum, palladium and indium.
     •    Silver increases the strength and decreases the creep while tin controls the reaction between silver and mercury.
          Without tin, the reaction would be too fast.
     •    Copper increases the strength, hardness and setting expansion of the alloy. Zinc acts as a deoxidiser and prevents
          the oxidation of silver, copper and tin.
     •    Platinum hardens the alloy and increases resistance to corrosion while palladium also hardens the alloy and in
          addition whitens it. On the other hand, indium reduces mercury vapour content in total.
     •    While there are several types of silver amalgam alloys, the two major types are the ‘low-copper alloys’, having
          copper content less than 6%, and ‘high-copper alloys’, having copper content more than 6%.
     •    In low-copper alloys, the powder when mixed with mercury results in the formation of γ2 phase, which is weak
          and responsible for their low strength and low resistance to tarnish and corrosion. However, this weak γ2 phase
          is eliminated in both admixed and single-composition-type high-copper alloys by the formation of a much
          stronger η phase.
     •    A high compressive and tensile strength is desirable for the success of silver amalgam in the oral cavity. Ideally, it
          should possess at least 310 MPa of compressive strength.
     •    High-copper alloys have higher compressive strength as they have copper which eliminates the weak γ2 phase.
     •    According to ADA Specification No. 1, amalgam should neither contract nor expand more than 20 um/cm when
          measured at 37°C between 5 minutes and 24 hours after the beginning of trituration.
     •    The time-dependent plastic deformation that occurs when stress is applied to amalgam is known as creep.
          According to ADA specification no. 1, creep of amalgam should be below 3%.
     •    Silver sulphide is the tarnish product of amalgam, whereas oxides and chlorides of tin are its corrosion products.
     •    The concept of bonded amalgam restorations was developed to improve the adhesion of amalgam to the
          tooth. The adhesive agents containing monomers such as 4-META and bis-GMA are applied to the tooth prepa-
          ration followed by placement of the restoration.
     •    While amalgam usually serves in the oral cavity for a considerable period of time, failures do occur. Some of the
          major reasons of its failure are bulk fracture of the restoration, marginal fracture and proximal overhangs.
     •    Amalgam restorations can also be repaired in certain cases, especially when the restoration is not in the area of
          heavy masticatory forces. One can just create an independent resistance and retention form for the fractured
          area and can place fresh amalgam adjacent to the existing one. The use of adhesives can improve the retention
          in such situations.

     Hand Condensation
     The amalgam mixture should never be touched with
     bare hands, because freshly mixed amalgam contains
     free mercury that can get absorbed via skin, and also
     the moisture on the skin is a source of contamina-
     tion for the amalgam.
        Increments of alloy should be inserted in the
     prepared cavity with the help of an amalgam carrier.

     Amalgam carrier is used to carry the mixed
     amalgam from the dappen dish to the prepared
     cavity (Fig. 16.10). It has a hollow end, into which
     the amalgam gets packed. This end is placed near
     the cavity preparation and the plunger at the back
     end of the carrier is pushed, which expresses the
     amalgam from the hollow end into the prepared
     cavity (Fig. 16.11). One can use two carriers at a
     time, while the operator places the amalgam into
     the prepared cavity; the assistant can load the second

          Burnishing
      Burnishing is a process in which a smooth, rigid
      instrument is used for smoothening the resto-
      ration surface that has become rough by carving.
      There is a conflict between what should be carried
      out first—burnishing or carving. If carving is done
      before burnishing, the effect of carving is lost after
      burnishing. If burnishing is done earlier, then
      carving leads to the production of rough surfaces.
      This has led to the concept of pre-carve burnishing
      and post-carve burnishing.                               Figure 16.13   Burnishing done by a ball burnishser.

     2. Obtaining the satin or velvet finish is the main
        aim of this step.

         Carving
     Carving is defined as the anatomical sculpturing of
     amalgam to re-obtain the original anatomy of the
     restored tooth. This is performed by using instru-
     ments called amalgam carvers. The cutting edges of
     these carvers are sharp, which are used to reproduce
     the anatomy of the restored tooth.
     Objectives
     The objectives of carving are as follows:
     1. To produce a restoration with proper physiolog-
         ical contours and no overhangs
     2. To produce a restoration with adequate marginal          Figure 16.15 Restorations completed and carving done

      KEY POINTS
      • It is important to understand the technical considerations of silver amalgam thoroughly in order to perform the
        restorative procedure in most efficient manner.
      • A high-copper alloy is mostly selected because of no γ2 phase and high early strength, low creep, good corrosion
        resistance and good resistance to marginal fracture.
      • The alloy powder:mercury ratio during proportioning is kept as 1:1 by volume and is referred to as Eames’
        technique.
      • The alloy powder and mercury are available as bottles containing bulk of mercury and bulk of alloy powder,
        pre-weighed pellets and disposable capsules.
      • The alloy powder and mercury are mixed thoroughly and this process is termed trituration. It can be manual or
        mechanical, the latter being a more standardised procedure.
      • Condensation refers to inserting the mixed amalgam into the prepared tooth structure by use of serrated
        condensers. Sufficient force is required to perform this step.
      • Burnishing refers to smoothening of the condensed amalgam by using a burnisher. It can be pre-carve burnishing
        or post-carve burnishing.
      • Carving refers to sculpturing of amalgam to re-obtain original anatomy of the restored tooth by use of various
        amalgam carvers.
      • The final step is finishing and polishing of the amalgam restoration, which provides a smooth and lustrous
        surface, thus increasing the longevity of the restoration.

     Bevelled Conventional Preparation                                 Modified Preparation
     Bevelled tooth preparations are similar to the conven-            Modified tooth preparation for composite resto-

     etching and bonding, which results in a strong tooth
     restoration interphase. On bevelling, ends of enamel
     rods are more effectively etched producing deeper
     micro-undercuts than when only the sides of enamel
     rods are etched. Also, providing a cavosurface bevel
     enables the restoration to blend more aesthetically
     with the surrounding tooth structure.
        This design is mostly used for Class III, IV and
     V restorations (Fig. 17.2). Bevels are not usually
     placed on the occlusal surface of posterior teeth
     because a conventional preparation design automat-
     ically produces end-on etching of the enamel rods
     (because of specific direction of enamel rods on
     these surfaces).                                                  Figure 17.3   Modified preparation.

         The objective of this preparation design is to
      remove the fault/caries as conservatively as possible
      and rely on ‘adhesion’ by the virtue of etching and
      bonding for the retention of the restoration in the
      tooth. This preparation finally has a ‘scooped-out’
      appearance in contrast to the ‘box-shaped’ conven-
      tional preparation design.

      tional and bevelled conventional tooth preparations.                    Dentinoenamel

     4. The facial and lingual extensions of the prox-
         imal box to be made are visualised and then the
         bur is moved gingivally to involve the proximal
         surface. This gingivally directed cut is 0.2 mm

     5. A 0.8-mm diameter 245 bur should cut in a way
         that it is one-fourth inside the dentin and three-

     9. No bevels are placed on the occlusal margins
         (Fig. 17.12) as it results in a thin layer of the
         composite on the occlusal surface in areas of
         potentially heavy contact. This can result in the
         fracture or wear of the composite restoration in
         these areas.
     10. No bevels are indicated for the facial and lingual
         walls of the proximal box unless the proximal
         box is too wide and bevels may help in increasing
         the surface area in this case for retention via

     Clinical Technique for Class III Preparation
     When the proximal surface of the tooth is to be
     restored and there is choice between the facial and
     the lingual entry into the tooth, the lingual approach
     is preferable.
         The advantages of restoring the proximal lesion
     from the lingual approach include the following:
     1. Tooth aesthetics is maintained since the
         facial enamel is conserved (unsupported, but            Figure 17.17 Class III preparation involving root surface.

      KEY POINTS
      • Tooth preparation for composite restoration is simpler and more conservative than amalgam restoration because
        of the micromechanical bonding of the former to the tooth structure.
      • Tooth preparation techniques can be categorised into conventional, bevelled conventional and modified
        techniques.
      • Conventional tooth preparations for composite resins are same as those typical for amalgam restorations.
      • In bevelled tooth preparations, conventional preparation is followed by placement of bevels in cavosurface
        margins, wherever applicable.
      • Modified tooth preparations are unique for the fact that in these preparations, only the affected area is removed
        and therefore this preparation has no specific configuration. These types of preparations are the most conserva-
        tive ones.
      • Other conservative preparations include the box-only preparation and the slot preparation.
      • Box-only preparation design is indicated when only the proximal surface is involved and the lesion does not
        extend up to the occlusal surface. In this, a proximal box is prepared and no occlusal extension is made.
      • Slot preparation design is made in those proximal caries cases where the marginal ridge is intact.
      • When the proximal surface of the tooth is to be restored (Class III) and there is choice between facial and lingual
        entry into the tooth, the lingual approach is preferred as it helps in preserving the natural enamel on the labial
        surface.
      • In Class IV preparations, the bevel is given on the labial surface as it increases the surface area for etching and
        bonding, and, thus, increases retention of the composite resin.
      • Similarly, a bevel is given on the incisal/occlusal wall of the Class V cavity preparation to increase the surface area
        for bonding.
      • In general, the cavity preparation designs for composite resins are much more conservative as compared with
        that required while restoring the tooth with silver amalgam.

      3. It is more technique sensitive in terms of etchant
         and bonding agent placement and requires
         absolute isolation.
      4. Discolouration of the restored tooth is observed,

      5. Marginal fractures and recurrent caries are not
         uncommon in teeth restored using composite
         resins.
      6. The restored tooth may exhibit post-operative
         sensitivity.
      7. It might also show greater occlusal wear in areas
         of high occlusal stresses.

         for Class II Cavities
     Restoration of a modified Class II tooth preparation
     (Fig. 18.19) with composite resin should be carried
     out carefully to ensure good adaptation of the mate-
     rial to the tooth surface, especially at the gingival
     floor, which is often overlooked.
                                                                  B
         The step-by-step procedure can be explained as
     follows:
     1. Matrix band is well adapted around the prepa-
         ration to ensure good contact and to avoid over-
         hangs. Use of dead soft matrix (metallic matrix
         which is so soft that it can be molded even with
         fingers; Fig. 18.20) or clear Mylar matrix (trans-
         parent matrix, which allows light to pass through       Figure 18.21 (A) Pre-operative picture of mesial caries

         choice.
     2. Etching and bonding is done as previously
         described.                                              3. For beginning the restorative procedure, flowable

                                                                     order to avoid any gaps in between the succes-

                                                                     procedure, followed by finishing and polishing
                                                                     of the restoration.

     KEY POINTS
     •       Proper isolation in tooth preparation is achieved using rubber dam, cotton rolls, etc.
     •       Acid etching is done using 37% phosphoric acid gel.
     •       The etchant is washed thoroughly and the area is dried but not desiccated.
     •       The dentin bonding agent is applied uniformly over the etched surface, left over for 20 seconds and then light
             cured. Composite resin is then placed in position, adapted and light cured.
     •       The next increment is then placed on top of it (preferably in an oblique pattern) and is light cured. Thickness of
             each increment should not exceed 2 mm.
     •       It is better to do slight overfilling to compensate for material loss during the finishing and polishing procedure.
     •       Scalpel or gold knife can be used to remove the excess material at cavosurface margins. Finishing can be obtained
             by using finishing discs in descending order of the abrasive particle size coated on them.
     •       Polishing can be done by using diamond polishing pastes at the end of the procedure to obtain final lustre.



     SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS
     1. Discuss the armamentarium required for placing a composite restoration.
     2. What do you mean by acid etching? Discuss in detail the technique.
     3. What is a dentin bonding agent? Discuss the importance of bonding and the procedure involved.
     4. Discuss the various techniques of placing composite resin restorative material.
     5. What are the different types of curing lights used for curing composite resin?
     6. How do you do the finishing and polishing of a composite resin restoration?

      A cast restoration is a restoration that has been cast
      in a mold or an object formed by the solidification
      of a fluid that has been poured/injected into a mold.
          According to Sturdevant, an inlay is primarily an
      intracoronal cast restoration that is designed mainly
      to restore the occlusal and/or proximal surface(s) of
      a posterior tooth and may cap one or more, but not
      all the cusps (Fig. 19.1).
          An onlay is a combination of intracoronal and
      extracoronal cast restorations which caps all the
      cusps of posterior teeth (Fig. 19.2)
          Cast restoration procedure requires two appoint-
      ments. In the first one, tooth preparation is done and
      the impression is made. While the patient is gone,                      Figure 19.2   Diagrammatic representation of an onlay.
      the impressions are poured to make models and the
      restoration is fabricated on these models. The patient                     Dr D. Philbrook, in 1817, has been credited

      KEY POINTS
      • A cast restoration is a restoration that has been cast in a mold or an object formed by the solidification of a fluid
        that has been poured/injected into the mold.
      • An inlay is primarily an intracoronal cast restoration that is designed mainly to restore the occlusal and/proximal
        surface(s) of a posterior tooth and may cap one or more but not all the cusps.
      • Class II inlay is indicated for large restorations, endodontically treated teeth, cracked teeth, when diastema
        closure is required, for correction of occlusal plane and in teeth that are going to act as abutment for removable
        prosthodontic appliance.
      • Class II metal inlay is not given in patients with high caries index, in aesthetic-sensitive zones and in very young
        patients.
      • Apart from the general principles of tooth preparation, cast restoration preparations should have three salient
        features: preparation path/draw path, apico-occlusal taper and the preparation features of the circumferential tie.
      • Plain cut carbide bur is used for the preparation in such a way so as to provide a path of draw.
      • Occlusal preparation is completed and thereafter a ditch is cut on the affected proximal side. The preparation is
        moved gingivally, below the carious lesion level.
      • Facial and lingual extensions of the box are made in a manner to achieve 0.5-mm clearance from the adjacent
        tooth.
      • Pulp protection is done, if necessary, using GIC as the base.
      • Retention grooves may be given if secondary retention is required.
      • Bevels and flares are then given. Different types of bevels used are as follows: partial bevel, short bevel, long
        bevel, full bevel, counter bevel and hollow ground (concave) bevel.
      • Primary flare is an integral component of an inlay preparation. Secondary flare may be given only if required.
      • Occlusal and gingival bevels are given to provide specific cavosurface design.
      • The occlusal bevels are then given in such a manner that the width of the cavosurface bevel on the occlusal
        margin should be approximately one-fourth the depth of the respective wall.
      • The modifications in the proximal preparation can be listed as follows: box preparation, slice preparation, auxil-
        iary slice preparation and box-cum-slice preparation.

    20                           Casting Procedure and
                                 Casting Defects

     Casting is the process by which a wax pattern of a
     restoration is converted to a replicate in dental alloy.
     In dentistry, the most commonly used technique
     for casting is the lost wax technique. The lost wax
     technique has been used for centuries, but its use in
     dentistry was made popular by W.H. Taggart in 1907.

         Lost-Wax Technique
     The steps involved in the process for lost wax casting
     are as follows:
     1. Create a wax pattern of cavity.
     2. Sprue the wax pattern.
     3. Invest the wax pattern.
     4. Wax burnout.
     5. Force molten metal into the mold (casting).
     6. Clean the cast.
     7. Finish and polish the casting on the die.               Figure 20.1   Blue inlay wax.
     Let us discuss all these steps, one by one, in detail.
                                                                                       Sprue former
     Create a Wax Pattern of the Cavity                                                attached to
                                                                                       the wax pattern
     The wax pattern of the prepared cavity is created
     using inlay wax (Fig. 20.1). The wax pattern can be
     ‘direct’ or ‘indirect’. While the ‘direct wax pattern’
     is made inside the patient’s mouth, the ‘indirect
     wax pattern’ is fabricated on the cast. Type I inlay
     wax is used in direct technique and Type II in
     indirect technique.

     Sprue the Wax Pattern
     The sprue former is attached to the wax pattern
     (Fig. 20.2). This, later, acts as a channel (sprue)
     through which the molten alloy can reach the mold,                                         Wax pattern
     after the wax has been eliminated. This sprue former
     can be made of metal, wax or plastic. The sprue            Figure 20.2 Wax pattern made on cast and sprue former
     formers can be either solid or hollow.                     attached to it.

     KEY POINTS
     • Indirect cast restorations need a wax pattern to be made either directly in the mouth or indirectly on the dye.
       Thereafter, the procedure of casting is done to convert the wax pattern into cast restoration, most commonly
       using the ‘lost wax technique’.
     • A sprue former is attached to the wax pattern and thereafter the entire assembly is placed on a crucible former.
     • A casting ring is placed around this assembly, which is lined by a casting ring liner. Into this hollow ring, a
       uniformly mixed investment material is poured which covers the entire wax pattern.
     • Once the investment material sets completely, it is placed in a furnace for wax burnout. The entire wax burns out
       through the sprue channel and a mold is thus created.
     • Into this mold, a molten metal is pushed, so that it can take up the entire space, which was occupied originally
       by the wax pattern. This procedure can be performed using various casting machines such as centrifugal casting
       machine and induction casting machine.
     • Once the molten metal solidifies and cools down, the investment is broken and the cast restoration is taken out
       and inspected.
     • Pickling, which refers to cleaning of the restoration by dipping it in a specific solution for cleaning it, is then performed.
     • Despite taking all good care during the entire procedure of casting, some casting defects may appear on the
       final casting.
     • These ‘casting defects’ can be categorised as under/oversized casting, distortion of casting, surface roughness
       and irregularities on the casting, incomplete casting, contaminated casting and porosities on casting.
     • Incorrect wax pattern, distorted wax pattern, improper investment or shrinkage of the alloy used for casting are
       the usual causes of under/oversized casting.
     • Distortion of the casting also happens due to distortion of the wax pattern in one way or the other.
     • If the imperfections seen on the casting are generalised and spread on the entire surface of the casting, it is
       termed ‘surface roughness’ and if present on a specific area it is called ‘surface irregularities’. These either
       become a hindrance in seating of the casting or require extra efforts in its polishing.
     • The casting at times may remain incomplete for several reasons such as incomplete wax elimination, improper
       heating of the mold to receive the molten alloy, less amount of alloy used and improper heating of the alloy
       which reduces its flow.
     • A casting, when retrieved, may look contaminated, either due to its oxidation or due to formation of sulphur
       compounds.
     • At times, certain kinds of porosities may appear on the casting such as localised shrinkage porosity, micropo-
       rosity, suck-back porosity, pinhole porosity, gas inclusions, subsurface porosity and back-pressure porosity.
     • In order to avoid all such casting defects, one must be careful to perform each and every step of casting proce-
       dure with utmost care so as to provide a well-fitting restoration to the patient.

         Erosion
     The word ‘erosion’ has been derived from the Latin
     word ‘erodere’, which means ‘eat out’. Tooth erosion
     is a gradual loss of normal hard surface of the tooth
     due to chemical, not bacterial, process.

     Scoring of Erosion Defects
     A simple scoring index was given by Bartleet et al. in            Figure 21.3 Erosion of the maxillary and the mandibular

     Erosion lesions are generally broad but shallow                   This is for the fact that flexure of the teeth due to

      KEY POINTS
      • Attrition is the mechanical wear of the incisal or occlusal surface of teeth which results from the functional or
        parafunctional movements of the mandible. This results in the flattening of cusp and, thus, leads to loss of the
        vertical dimensions of the tooth.
      • Abrasion is defined as wearing of the tooth substance because of grinding, rubbing or scraping caused by
        external mechanical means, such as repeated contact of the teeth with foreign objects or substances.
      • Tooth erosion is a gradual loss of normally hard surface of the tooth due to chemical, not bacterial, process.
      • Abfraction lesions are defined as wedge-shaped defects in the cervical region of the tooth caused by abnormal
        occlusal loading, leading to mechanical and chemical wear.
      • Combined lesions such as attrition–abfraction and abrasion–abfraction also exist, which must be recognised.
      • Amelogenesis imperfecta represents a group of hereditary defects of the enamel unassociated with any other
        generalised defects. It presents with abnormal formation of the enamel of the teeth.
      • Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary mesodermal disturbance marked by imperfect formation and calcifi-
        cation of the dentin, giving the teeth a brown or blue opalescent appearance.
      • Non-hereditary enamel hypoplasia is defined as an incomplete or defective formation of the organic enamel
        matrix of the teeth.

      KEY POINTS
      • Tooth fracture refers to the breakage of the tooth structure because of an impact which is greater than the
        tooth’s resistance.
      • The aetiological factors that cause fracture are as follows: iatrogenic injuries in the newborn, fall in infancy, auto-
        mobile accidents, drug-related/mental retardation injuries, sports injuries, etc.
      • Ellis classification divides the types of tooth fractures into nine categories, from Types I to IX.
      • A patient reporting after dental trauma should be thoroughly examined, clinically and radiographically.
      • Uncomplicated crown fractures can be well treated by use of composite resins, while complicated crown frac-
        tures have to undergo direct pulp capping, partial pulpotomy/Cvek pulpotomy or pulpectomy depending on the
        extent of pulpal involvement.
      • Direct pulp capping refers to the procedure in which a suitable medicament (such as calcium hydroxide) is placed
        directly over a small pulp exposure in a caries-free zone.
      • Partial pulpotomy/Cvek pulpotomy refers to removal of coronal pulp tissue up to the level of healthy pulp
        (usually up to 2 mm).
      • Pulpectomy refers to the removal of entire pulp from the coronal as well as radicular portion of the tooth.
      • A crown–root fracture refers to a fracture involving enamel, coronal and radicular dentin and cementum, and its
        treatment depends on the level of fracture.
      • Root fracture is a fracture involving radicular dentin, cementum and pulp.
      • Vertical fractures, whenever present, are difficult to diagnose, unless the two segments are completely apart, and
        usually have a poor prognosis.
      • Concussion and subluxation injuries represent minor injuries to the periodontal ligament and pulp caused by an
        acute impact.

     • Avulsion (exarticulation) refers to complete displacement of the tooth out of its socket. The tooth is replanted
       if possible or is placed in an appropriate storage medium within 15–20 minutes, until the patient can get to the
       dental office for reimplantation by the dentist.

     23                          Vital Pulp Therapy


      Treatment of the exposed pulp by pulp capping has
      a long clinical history. The purpose of the treatment
      is to keep the exposed pulp vital and functioning in
      the tooth. A number of experimental studies have
      shown that pulp capping may have a success rate
      close to 90% if specific clinical criteria are met and
      the treatment is performed correctly.
          For pulp capping to be successful, the following
      factors are of decisive importance:
      1. The condition of the pulp (pre-operative diagnosis)
      2. The pulp capping material
      3. Obtaining a permanent bacteria-tight seal of the
           pulp cavity
          Pre-operative diagnosis can be made by obtaining
      correct history regarding the kind of associated
      pain, visual examination of the carious dentin and          Figure 23.1   Zinc oxide eugenol.
      radiographic examination.
          Vital pulp therapy for primary and young perma-
      nent teeth can be broadly classified into two catego-
      ries: ‘indirect pulp capping’, applied in cases where
      the pulp is not exposed, and ‘direct pulp capping’,
      implemented in case of pulp exposure. These
      methods of vital pulp therapy assist in retaining the
      vitality of the tooth.

          Materials Used for Vital Pulp Therapy
      Various materials have been used till date for vital
      pulp therapy, for example, zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE)

       KEY POINTS
      • The purpose of the vital pulp therapy is to keep the exposed pulp vital and functioning in the tooth.
      • Various materials can be used for performing vital pulp therapy, for example, ZOE, calcium hydroxide and MTA.
      • Vital pulp therapy procedure basically includes performing the indirect and direct pulp capping procedures.
      • Indirect pulp capping is defined as the application of a medicament over a thin layer of remaining carious dentin
        (with no pulp exposure). The majority of soft, necrotic, infected dentin is removed using a large round bur in
        low speed or using a sharp spoon excavator. The remaining affected dentin is covered with hard-setting calcium
        hydroxide. The remainder of the cavity is filled with a reinforced ZOE. After 6–8 weeks, it is then permanently
        restored if asymptomatic.
      • In direct pulp capping procedure, a suitable medicament is placed directly over the pulp exposure, which is very
        small, caries free and adequately isolated. Calcium hydroxide and MTA can be used for this purpose.

     • Pulpotomy is defined as the surgical removal of the entire coronal pulp presumed to be partially or totally
       inflamed and quite possibly infected, leaving intact the vital radicular pulp within the canals. A medicament
       (formocresol or calcium hydroxide, etc.) is then placed over the remaining vital radicular pulp stumps.
     • Apexogenesis is the term used when there is induced continuation of root apex formation in case the entire
       radicular pulp is not inflamed. Use of calcium hydroxide is widely advocated for apexogenesis.
     • Apexification is the term used when there is induced formation of a calcific barrier at the root apex by using
       medicaments such as calcium hydroxide or MTA.

      involved tooth to any patient. Three basic steps
      which need to be performed for correct diagnosis
      are discussed next.

      History
      History of sensitivity to hot and cold, persistence
      of pain even after removal of stimulus, history of
      continuous pain, pain on lying down, etc., are all
      suggestive of pulp involvement. History of pus
      discharge is suggestive of chronic infection with
      abscess formation or periapical cyst/granuloma.
      This discharge can be intraoral or extraoral.                        Figure 24.1   Hot gutta-percha sticks.

     1. The tooth length is measured on the preopera-
         tive radiograph.
     2. For ‘safety allowance’, 1.0 is subtracted to account
         for image distortion or magnification.

     5. On the radiograph, the difference is measured
         between the end of the instrument and the
         end of the root. If the end of the instrument is
         beyond the root apex, then the length is reduced;
         if it is shorter than the apex, then the length is
         increased. Finally, the end of the instrument               Figure 24.21       Apex locator.

     Of all the techniques listed earlier, lateral compaction
     technique is most commonly used and is described
     as follows:
     1. The canal is dried using paper points (Fig. 24.33).
     2. Primary or master cone is inserted to the estab-
         lished WL. It should fit snugly and resist its
         removal (Fig. 24.34).
     3. Radiograph is taken to determine the apical and
         lateral fit (Fig. 24.35).
     4. Walls of the canal and the apical half of the
         primary cone are coated with a sealer (zinc oxide

      KEY POINTS
      • In cases where the pulp gets infected for one reason or the other, RCT (endodontic treatment) is advocated to
        save the tooth.
      • A thorough clinical and radiographic examination is essential before starting RCT.
      • Pulp vitality tests, wherever required, must be done to assess the status of the pulp.
      • Isolation of tooth with rubber dam is mandatory for performing endodontic therapy.
      • One should be thorough with the morphology of the root canal system before attempting to begin with an
        endodontic procedure.
      • Access openings of maxillary anterior teeth are made from the palatal surface, while those of maxillary premolars
        and molars are made from the occlusal surface.
      • Access openings of mandibular anterior teeth are made from the lingual surface, while those of mandibular
        premolars and molars are made from the occlusal surface.
      • WL is then determined, which refers to measuring the length of the root canals so that entire infected pulp may
        be removed, leaving behind no source of infection. Radiograph or an apex locator can be used for this purpose.
      • Cleaning and shaping is then done using files. Step-back technique is commonly used for this purpose.
      • Obturation of the root canals is then done using GP, lateral compaction technique being widely used for this.
      • Once the obturation is complete, the access opening is sealed with a suitable high-strength restorative material
        so as to seal the root canal system from the oral environment.
